Very High Employee turn over. They skim you on hours during inclement weather. You have to go through this dumb training system like your going to be a rocket scientist but you get paid like your flipping burgers (sorry if I offended you career burger flippers). A lot of micro managing. You will fill out the same paperwork a dozen different ways for one job and don’t forget to not check a box cause they will be hunting you down...

Family takes a back seat to Work; Promotions based on who you know or where you went to school (A&M, OU) rather than accomplishments. Intern program is especially corrupt, as most Internships are handed out to children of VPs.

2015-06-03;SAP Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Good Company to work in San Antonio;"In San Antonio, one of the better employers in terms of salaries and benefits (certainly not the best in my opinion). Health and fitness is part of Valero culture. It's implicitly understood that all the employees will be out for a workout during lunch hours. Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind. It offers great work life balance. It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well. Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.
";"Valero is a conservative company. They offer very less vacation time. Work hours flexibility is less. Work-from-home option is not available. The pay (salary and benefits) may not seem attractive if compared to an IT organization. There can be a bit of micro-management.

2016-02-01;Benefits Analyst;Current Employee;The Best Company in the US;"Best place to work because: you have the opportunity to help others, the community you work in, your co-workers treat you with respect, the benefits are very competitive since they help you pay for your benefits, Valero cares about your well-being since they have fitness center, clinic @ head quarters and they provide a Gym subsidy for those not working at head quarters, they also provide a subsidy for day care, they also help you understand how fortunate we all are by being able to donate to many charities, and NO they don't force you to donate!, you decide for yourself how much to contribute, great pension plan, 401k matching, I can keep going on and on how great Valero is! Lastly, you get yo meet the CEO once you are hired, I mean where do you can the chance to meet the CEO, nowhere.. They also provide many charity events for our veterans, children, and many other social events that benefit the community.
";"It's hard to think about anything negative since they truly provide a great work environment.

2012-11-17;Supervisor;Current Employee, more than 10 years;A great culture of working hard, paying well, and giving back to the community.;"Valero provides an excellent working environment for employees, complete with on-site childcare, doctor, cafeteria, and a fitness center with tennis and basketball courts, and running trails. The company offers a leading employee compensation plan that includes excellent medical coverage options, along with a pension and 401k, among other things.
";"I know there are disgruntled employees who work here, but I struggle to understand it. It is not the place it was in 2005 when the stock price was soaring and splitting, but this is still a top of the line place to work. The best I can do to complain is to say that the upward mobility takes time. Even then, part of the reason for that is due to the fact that most employees choose not to leave, and this inhibits other people from potential promotions, transfers, etc.

2015-06-26;Engineer;Former Employee;Valero Renewable Fuels;"Being a part of the parent company, Valero ETEP for engineers, benefits, access to Subject Matter Experts from parent company, safe place to work, good intern program.
";"Being micromanaged by all employees in various departments including your own, not a diverse workforce, not being acknowledged for your ideas as they get stolen, most of the ethanol plants are not near major cities, not acknowledged for working in several fields aside from your main duties, higher than normal employee turnover, a sense of entitlement in some of the key workers in all departments, some employees get ""pigeon-holed"" into an area or expertise, salary/pay is in the lower end of the industry, office/plant/division politics, employment termination can be based on lies, does not have a formal training program for the industry (ethanol production) like the refining division has.

2013-03-16;Retail Systems Support Level I;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Pretty great college job for a student.;"Great employee benefits. Wonderful bonuses at the start of every year (for corporate employees). Many gatherings/office parties/perks to working. Well paying! A lot of great minds are at Valero. Located in a really accessible part of town. Very good employee cafe at great prices. Upper management is usually easy to speak with.
";"The office has this high-school like clique system. Office is stuck with a 'classic' business attitude and can feel a little boring/draining, like every day is the same work over and over. Company E-Mails workers with proclamations to vote 'yes' or 'no' on. Expect a lot of time commitment out of their student workers. The office does not have many part-time workers, so they are not very understanding for those who are still growing their education. Does not promote creative growth of their employees. Office coffee is horrid. (I know this shouldn't be in the cons list, but if you try it - you'll understand).

2018-02-01;Process Engineer;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Lots of employee growth opportunities but doesn't value employees;"There is a lot of career growth opportunities, especially for younger engineers. Good centralized training at corporate. High exposure potential to upper management/corporate.
";"Not open to relocation to other refineries, high expectation on time at work (50hrs/week as a regular), no overtime on turnarounds (many oil companies offer this), no 9/80s, no flexibility in work schedule. Only hires engineers straight from college, and with the amount of experienced engineers either moving into other roles or leaving the company this is creating a very very young engineering group. This makes it hard to learn as a new engineer and hurts the reputation of the engineering group in the eyes of the rest of the refinery.

The company is very organized and has an entire document center that keeps files going back many years.

";"If there is a location you are interested in within the Valero network, apply there and no where else. Once inside Valero, there are no transfers, unless it's related to a promotion. Valero is very frugal when it comes to relocation. There have been MANY high performing individuals that has left the company because of Valero's refusal to relocate on a lateral basis. Also, if you're not into the United Way, every year, you'll feel like you're being hounded and harassed to contribute.
