The program is excellent, they provide every thing from monthly salary ( more than $2000) which increase by 15% when you finish half your major. They also take care of the tuition and they provide book allowance each semester that is $ 1000. The pay a close attention to their student with a visit each semester and a private meeting with each student to check up on them. They give also rewards each semester for those who perform well that ranges from ( 500$ to 1000$) depending on their GPA. At the last summer of your study, they refer their student to some of the large companies in U.S to do an internship.

Pros
Excellent benefits package, great community life, good schools, safe quiet surroundings, exposure to different cultures, good salary, interesting work and plenty of it. Great vacation package and easy to reach superb and exotic destinations (e.g., India, Nepal, China, Philippines, Thialand, other Gulf States, etc.). Friendly people. 401K is matched by company at 9%, retirement pension is outstanding and rare in today's corporate world. Can take lump sum payment at early retirement (10 years service and over 50 years of age).
Cons
You are away from the US. Some people find this disconcerting at first, but it does lessen with time. Prices in community are rising. Some communication problems. Some restrictions on daily westernized lifestyle.

Anyone thinking of joining, please think it over and if possible talk to someone who recently left (there are many) as otherwise you may end up in a very toxic environment.

";"Lack of management skill to deal with a diverse workforce (partially solved when they decided to purge hundreds of westpats in the middle of a pandemic). Overwhelming amount of work and too many bystanders. Erosion of benefits, promotions, and overall quality of life within the “expat” camp. If one is looking for an overseas assignment there are better options elsewhere.

2021-09-12;Mechanical Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Burn(ing) out;"1. Good salary 2. Ample vacation time (especially if your coming from America) 3. Job security (if your a Saudi) I’m not an expat but I would say aramco is pretty great for late career expats.
";"1. Locals will be privileged. Expats will go nowhere from their hired positions. 2. Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is. More landmines to get dinged by whenever the umpteenth priority 1 item simply can’t be dealt with in the expected manner - time and qualitatively comprehensively. The priority changes on a daily basis at any given hour sometimes even 2-3 times a day.

";"Where to begin?! If you’re seeking career progression as an expat you’re most certainly coming for the wrong reasons. The company appear to believe that money = satisfaction. If you’re an expat my advice is don’t bother. They simply don’t care about your happiness nor utilising their staff to their full potential. They want to be seen as an ‘employer of choice’, yet when people are keen to contribute to the company and move into new roles they don’t support you at all. I appreciate that there’s a push for Saudization, however the company is losing vital knowledge and real-world experience by not actively engaging many of their expat staff, and we’re treated as being expendable. I can safely say that’s exactly how I’ve been treated. Time to start looking elsewhere… the cons far outweigh the benefits for me at this point.

";"Leave what often not approved till last minute (difficult holiday planning). No career advancement for expats (maybe one promotion if you are lucky and on good relations with your management and you have exposure to Senior Management) - if not forget any promotions as these go to locals. Expected to travel to work sites at moments notice. During construction in PMT you are at the site which can be anywhere in the Kingdom. You will either be transferred OR begin FIFO (which is 5 days on, 2 days off). Very little regard for family/work life balance. Working in PMT suits bachelor more than family status. Often having to leave office to take kids to doctor/dental appointments, etc was frowned upon.

2020-10-21;Secretary;Former Employee, more than 3 years;undervauled, disrespected and boring;"Salary Vacation days Weather Good benefits Little commute time
";"The Secretary duties are very boring, you mostly make tea/coffee and fill bowls with nuts abd spend your days correcting english on letters only to be told its incorrect by people who do not speak fluent english! There is little or no scope for progression. If you get based in a remote area it can be very isolating. The accomodation is old and mould infested. As a newbie you enter on lowest points so are not entitled to a newer build. You have no control over what Manager/Department you get assigned to or what city you end up in. Most Managers are difficult. You will experience some form of disrespect. You will be spoken to like a piece if rubbish. They are allowed to comment on your weight, too fat/too skinny. HR will ignore complaints. If you flirt and laugh at others misfortune you will be fine. You get no training and no assistance on their systems, you are just expected to know how they work. Camp life can get boring very quickly unless you go to parties all of the time. That novelty soon wears off. People are not very friendly, most of the expats are nuts. This can really get a person down as its constant negativity. There are some decent ones but few and far between. ""Wasta"" is still very much a way of life there.

2020-09-22;Human Resources Advisor;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Saudi Aramco in Dhahran;"A pleasing community to live in camp. Pleasantville Arizona... Don't rely on getting across to Bahrain easily, as so are 40,000 others - and it really doesn't have much to offer. Lot's of interesting projects to work on, with very nice Saudis. Warm and pleasant, humorful and non-judgmental. Surrounded by well educated and generally pleasant colleagues from all over the world, who have a great community social life. Everything is only 5 minutes away if you live in camp. Opportunities abound for those who are willing to be agile, productive and positive. A good and surprisingly large hospital, in the camp. Many excellent Saudi staff, surgeons etc.
";"Many people will arrive on there first day at work to be told that they don't have the role they've been contacted for. Bit frustrating after a year to get gain the position and actually get there. Managers move around and the info doesn't always get to the replacement. You still get paid though. If your managers really don't want you after you have arrived, they may play the 'don't give her any work' game. Then as you have been sitting around twiddling your thumbs they'll call you in on your 90th day and tell you that you've failed probation because you haven performed, so go home again and pack. Managers often can't make decisions and don't read for more than 30 seconds - which may mean a shift in your expectations - or you can just allow it to irritate you; or you can just carry on and smile. The camp families tend to be a bit cliquey, so if you don't fit their social circle you could be politely avoided. Specific religious beliefs, married or single, that kind of clique. Don't expect a reference when you leave - they just don't give you one, unless you personally request from a friendly manager. It's difficult to come back into the real world if you have been there for 5 years or more, as your overseas experience will be probably ignored by recruiters.

";"If you get assigned to a difficult Manager it will negatively impact your overall experience. As a Westerner you may encounter disrespect and resentment. The Secretary role duties can be very mundane and there is very little scope for progression. You may be working in a building away from the main area which can feel isolating, with no canteen or few expats. Life on camp is ok, if bland. It is compound life and you do get used to it, but it can feel very enclosed. The houses are somewhat dated, but they are ok. Some expats (there are some exceptions, thankfully!) are surprisingly not that welcoming and friendly. Weather is very hot from April to October, particularly in June, July and August. Finally, it is a 'lucky dip' to which department you get assigned to. A good/bad Manager can make/break the experience.

";"Honestly, Aramco in general is a hostile working environment. They speak of 'great initatives' however, do not expect to see those initiatives come to life. Women are not valued (Saudi and expat), the performance rating scale is forced - if you are not a favorite, don't expect a good annual bonus. Many say the salary is great however, content is required. The salaries are higher than most companies - if you look outside the Oil/Gas industry. However, compared to other national oil/gas companies around the world, compensation is standard. Again, this is coming from an HR Business Partner - who has visibility to everything behind closed doors at the senior management level. No, I am not a bitter employee, I actually receive great performance reviews. However, my high performance reviews do not make me oblivious to my surroundings or oblivious to the struggles of my colleagues.

They are looking for ""workers"" who do what told to get the work done since the locals cannot and will not. Don't expect to be treated fairly or equally. Don't expect integrity and accountability for locals. Credit for your work will be given to locals - they are masters at manipulating the systems and management. Management is clueless, most have no background in the areas they manage, don't care as most stay in a position for a few months (revolving door). If you are interviewing for jobs in Learning Support and Solutions (LSSD), Academic Programs and Partnerships (AP&P) or Program Development and Evaluation (PD&ED) run away - the work environment is horrific, discriminatory, tons of locals with no skills, and incompetent management. Don't believe anything you are told. Lying is the norm as is manipulation.

2019-02-19;IT Network Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;IT Engineer;"This is best place to work for an IT professional in my opinion. There are always huge IT projects being conducted. Saudi Aramco lives and thrives on IT Technology. There always opportunity to establish yourself in the field. Although, career advancement is limited, financial compensation and benefits are very rewarding. If work in Saudi Arabia, you can easily travel around the world, when vacation comes. Another huge advantage is that the workplace here is very harmonious. No backtalk or politicking in the workplace is allowed. The meals at the dining halls of Saudi Aramco are all gourmet and subsidized by Saudi Aramco and offered at a low cost to employees and contractors. Saudi Aramco has personnel from all over the world. It is great multicultural environment to work in. Saudi Aramco is unparalleled in my opinion.
";"Do not expect a direct promotion here. You do your job and pass on your expertise to young Saudis. There are no deadwood jobs here anymore like in the old times. You can use your free time to gain new skills and then apply for other job opportunities within the Company. Lookout for new projects that can enhance your career and help you move up.

The people in charge of me are only there because they are from the Sunni tribe no other reason. They can't even do my job much less there job. Lots of favoritism among the locals. If your a expat and think your gonna move up the career ladder, don't your not that's just how it goes over here. As far as training goes you don't get any mostly reserved for the local population. Seems like we do the same thing many times in row hoping for a different result.......scary. Definitely a blame culture for sure if you are a expat....go figure. As far as it goes for now you will never get hired direct only contractors so you can never take advantage of the benefits, so there is really no reason to come over truly a waste of time effort and energy its just a new game and you really don't want to be the expat slave because that's what you will be I promise.

";"Its hard to believe you are working for the most valuable company in the world! Financial incentives are diminishing every year due to following: 1. Increasing  Saudi taxes you are expected to pay lump sum while other companies pay them on behalf of their employees. 2. Bring you over from a foreign country and make you pay full rent & bills (electric etc.) of housing in the camp. 3. Education allowance no longer covers full education fees because ""they phased out the grandfather system"" and schools are increasing fees substantially. 4. You are responsible for paying visas (the right to go in and out of a country you are a resident in!) Also rising.... 5. Incremental annual increases are way below tge very high rates if inflation Saudi Arabia is experiencing. 6. There is a wide gap between US employees and ""other"" nationalities who are treated in every aspect as 2nd class even if you work harder and better at your job than your American counterpart. When you add all these costs and compare them against current salaries the incentive to move from another country and work for SA diminish.

2018-05-28;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Insane benefits, and above average compensation that’s all;"The compensation was good if you’re an expatriate and benefits also crazy good. Your paycheck hits on time and the expatriates overseas that have been there for 7-10 years make it bearable. International contacts are also good.
";"They locals mostly lie through their teeth, don’t know how to do anything, raises are non existent and not based on anything close to reality. A lot of good expatriates come in being honest but you eventually start committing fraud to the terms of millions of dollars of ill gotten gains. When I took proof of this and filed the report with internal audit personally their response was to write it off to lack of Saudi experience. Amazingly when the auditors followed up with me three years in a row about the same issues that I delineated point by point in an e-mail with attached proof I finally gave up. When they acknowledged my e-mail year 1 is due to incompetence, year 2 (assuming the auditors outliners the issues in year 1 should not occur in year 2. If the same issues occur in year 3 & 4 that clearly tells you everything you need to know. From a career perspective there is literally zero growth whatsoever. Long story short stay away it’s not worth the sacrifice unless you’re exactly 49.5 years old and can arrive for day 1 prior to 50. If you can hang on for 10 years and you’ll leave with roughly $2.5MM USD in post tax savings and healthcare for life at about $400 / month for you and your spouse. This last part might change as I’ve heard they’ve been cutting back a lot over the past two years since I left. Of all the departments within Aramco New Business Development and Procurement were the worst. Corporate Planning at least tried to be runr pforessionally. The problem in Corporate Planning is that most answers were preordained before the Management Committee meetings even took place to make a formal go or no go decision.

Low stress work environment - can get away with doing little or nothing. Lifestyle for US expatriates in Dhahran are outstanding - like living at a resort. Compensation per unit of work output, is very high (not because pay is high, but required work output is very low).

Down side is that your professional skills will atrophy, rendering you unemployable anywhere else. Great place to retire from; horrible as a stepping stone to something better.
