2021-09-17;Environmental Specialist I;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Not bad for entry level, would be bad for long term;"You learn a ton when you're starting out, benefits I remember being somewhat decent, relative stability in this field, safety was a very high priority.
";"Tasks were extremely tedious, lots of down time (could be a good thing and a bad thing), moving up in the company takes forever, mandatory temp period that they say only last 6 months but regularly lasts longer than that, customers that you work for can be extremely demanding, management said they would fire us if we discussed salaries with our coworkers (which is extremely illegal), pay was pretty pathetic for the Boston/Cambridge area, regularly have to work with toxic/hazardous chemicals

";"- Mistakes in the system can take a long time to be addressed and fixed - There doesn't seem to be a career path upward, above the managerial level, for local staff - Compensation is on the low end; it is a low-growth utility company

2021-08-31;Office Administrator;Former Employee;Purchasing system incredibly slow and bureaucratic;"Pay was good and the 401k program was good.
";"My job required purchasing supplies and equipment on short notice. There was no time to go through the tedious process to have accounting generate purchase orders and I wasn't allowed to use a company credit card. So I had to put 4k-6,000 dollars on my personal credit card each month to pay for needed equipment and supplies. Each month I was fearful that my expense reports would be delayed and I would not be able to pay my personal bills and rent. Extremely stressful.

";"The GM has his friends as supervisor's for each department. You can't even follow your proper chain of command. They pile work on top of you, and they expect you to do many job titles without any compensation or recognition. The management has absolutely no clue how to manage a team.

There are many facets to Veolia's business. Corporate overhaul has trimmed excess and efficiency is a top priority.
";"Autonomous middle managers, especially those who take a hands-off & reactive management approach, create a chaotic culture. Ironic how the company just went through a ""unification"" campaign titled One Veolia resulting in more levels of separation and dissatisfaction throughout this local organization.

2020-07-11;Environmental Specialist I;Current Employee, more than 1 year;DO NOT WORK HERE;"Benefits, potential high pay and nothing else!
";"The work environment is horrible, but especially for women. This is a total good boys club and if you aren't friends with the higher ups, and drink with them then you are not getting promotions and will be put into the worst jobs/situations, and they will punish you for not ""being in the circle"". This company led me on for a year, had me doing work for a position they never intended to give me and kept stringing me along, all while promoting their friends. They don't carry themselves professionally and it's actually sad watching the way they speak to customers, they're a joke to work for and with. I do not recommend this company to anyone, but ESPECIALLY to those who have a degree. They will put you in the lowest position and try to get you to drive trucks. They're an environmental company that doesn't even recycle or have one care for their environmental impact. If you care about using your education or at least having your degree provide you with a better position than what someone with a GED would get then do not even look twice at this place. OH and if you hate nepotism then this company will drive you wild! They hire family and only take care of each other so you'll never have a position that meets your potential because they'd rather give it to someone completely incompetent than to you. If you're a women they speak poorly of you, expect you to do physically tasking work and don't stand up for you when men in the field are sexually harassing you. If they do bring anything to HR, it goes no where and nothing gets resolved. It's a toxic work environment and I hope to lead people away from experiencing anything I went through.

2020-02-17;Laboratory Technician;Former Employee, less than 1 year;You don't want this job.;"Pay slightly above market rate
";"Long hours, confusion and chaos, checked out/clueless managers, negative culture have lead the laboratory to become a revolving door department. If you interview, make sure to ask them about their turnover rate, why they think it's so high, and what they plan to do to address it. During the interview they'll offer you a tour - see what a mess the lab and the lab offices are - ask yourself if this seems like a company on top of things. I accepted this position when they offered a 30% raise over my previous position, left less than a year later after the other two members of the department quit (they made it six and ten months, respectively). Accepted a position that paid 19% lower than Veolia and I'm much better off for it. Trust me, you do not want this job.

";"Around 2013 there was a visible shift. Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment. Productivity is also hurt by poor information technology, employees have to navigate different systems and locations to find what they need.

If you then pass the exam, which is open book, you receive a raise and become an ES II... Working onsite at different facilities can be very interesting and lead to networking and new job opportunities.
";"Extremely high turn over rate leads to low moral and the overworking of employees. Management does not provide aid to overworked employees at all. The management in Latham consistently makes false promises to employees, further depleting moral.

After 7 months of waiting for a start date from the company they rescinded the offer of employment due to a perceived disability. Despite my previous experience in a very similar chemical plant and offers to provide documentation and other evidence to prove my experience and ability to perform the duties of the job the company pulled the offer. The company implied during a phone conversation that I hid the perceived disability and offered no reasonable accommodations. It is not the responsibility of the applicant to disclose anything that could be considered a disability or offer accommodations. Per the ADA that is the responsibility of the company.

";"Less than stellar ethics amongst several individuals in the “top” management of Veolia North America (VNA). Also, the current crop of Senior leaders have an operations background and hence see everything in operations terms. They have close to zero idea on how to grow the company (“Business Development”) and assume an operations mindset is transferable to BD. In the past 2-years, near- Constant reorganization has gutted BD; about 20-mid-to-senior BD executives (especially in the M&C group) have been summarily fired or just quit. People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management. The annual strategy meetings are an example of kiss-up, kick down. Net-net, the company is losing contracts to its competitors. Again, VNA is an OK place if you want an operations focused career. But stay away if you want to do Business Development.

I recommend only staying for two years or less at maximum and then look for another job.
";"Laboratory management loves to micromanage employees. Expect to be criticized if you do things your way. Theres a lot of gossip going around with the senior staff who bad mouth other employees. Very little to no team player effort by senior staff. They will belittle you, and information does not spread evenly through staff. You will hear differences in information within the department. The laboratory needs to work on their Environmental, Health, and Safety culture as well. Some fume hoods did not work, which leads to higher exposure of hazardous chemicals. There is favoritism as well. Little to no upward mobility within the laboratory even after I assumed more responsibility after another employee left. They will overwork you, and still won't offer you more pay. Overall, I would say the lab has a very unprofessional atmosphere and toxic work culture.

2019-04-30;Manager;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Poor senior leadership;"Decent benefits: commuter, phone etc.
";"No accountability for performance. Most employees I have interacted with like to push work into others or it doesn’t get done at all, with no consequences. No incentive to actually exceed expectations. Senior management is old and lacks any imagination. The employees that excel in their roles are under paid and usually leave after they can’t bear the frustration any more.

2019-05-02;Building Maintenance;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Good company for the most part;"The company is only as good as your immediate management team, so as far as day to day it was pretty good. Big company so if willing to relocate it seems there are plenty of opportunities
";"A lot of things from the corporate level that trickled down seemed to be things that justified peoples jobs. Redundant safety videos, a lot of paperwork that served no purpose other than to waste ink and paper. Safety was a big deal so for the most part that was good except the safety rules and regulations should have been site specific rather than a broad corporate rule. The pay was better than the benefits

2019-04-14;Environmental Services;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Say what you mean and mean what you say.;"Working in the Environmental Services division for nearly 20 years I always had a sense of being apart of something big and contributing to society.
";"Around 2013 there was a visible shift. Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment. Productivity is also hurt by poor information technology, employees have to navigate different systems and locations to find what they need.

2019-03-20;Director;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Could be a good company but corporate leadership is inbred;"Great people at the operating and technical levels. The water and environmental services business units are competent and well managed.
";"The energy business unit is entirely district energy focused and have no views on how to grow. The leadership in that group is simply inbred and a good number of them need to be replaced with new people who have broader views on the industries that they could grow in. Too much effort is spent on spinning a marketing story and not enough on actual resources to develop and deliver services. They could be great if they actually believed and delivered on what they print in there own brochures.

";"Terrible work environment, most employees are miserable, poor overall leadership, zero training given to employees and no direction at all, top level management is barely ever there and doesn’t interact with anyone when there, too much dead weight in the sales structure eats up profits.
