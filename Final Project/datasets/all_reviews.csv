";"More and more, the wrong people are become supervisors without adequate skills and training. Management will defend them to no end while constantly criticizing individual contributors. The amount of rework on small things is outrageous meanwhile critical tasks aren't getting completed due to poor work prioritization from the supervisor. New performance assessments are more of a popularity and personality contest as supervisors fail to understand and give proper credit for real work by employees. People will tell outright lies to try and get their way or put others down. Employee concerns are not properly addressed as the organization only cares about what's coming from the top-down. The individuals who do care aren't are in a position to bring change. Work life balance and flex policies are a joke for most jobs. My coworkers are stressed, frustrated, and running out of patience. Despite all this, management continues to paint things as a pretty picture and will repeatedly talk about culture and ""one team"" and how we should be so excited to be a part of this work. There are way too many managers and too many p***ing contests that results in lack of clarity and constant change in direction for individual contributors. Leadership team is nearly all male and white. Contributions by and perspective from people of color are diminished whereas others are recognized for doing base business job functions.

";"Non-transparent leadership. Politics, general bureaucracy continue to trump culture change attempts and ranking. Ranking relative to peers - so there will always be someone in the bottom to fire no matter how talented/hard working they are. Ranking system focused on number of worklist items completed and not taking into account intangible impacts like mentoring, taking initiative to step up to fill gaps for advising, creating/maintaining strong teams and a positive culture. Supervisors resist real change despite being advocates for culture change. Culture change driven from top down and formed to suit leadership although presented to satisfy the majority of the workforce. Company struggles to remedy low moral after COVID-19; 401k match paused and sizeable firings disguised as headcount studies and performance rankings. Company leadership has directly replied to the workforce that they should be happy and thankful they still have a job when asked what the leadership's plan was to resolve low morale and restore the elements that attract and retain employees. Only 2 weeks vacation for new hires, do not get 3rd week until 5 years of service (they do honor previous employment).

81;ExxonMobil;2021-08-19;Supply Chain Coordinator;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Escape while you can!;"- Some peers make this place bearable through trauma bonding - The campus is beautiful and you can take froyo breaks - If you are lucky enough to be at one of the Houston sites, you do not have state income tax - You get to learn if you like oil, gas, & chemicals or not
";"- The worst management (including supervisors) gets promoted & many are micromanagers - Upper management has selective hearing when it comes to feedback - Some sites (Beaumont and Baton Rouge) are worse than living in Chernobyl - All the diverse and friendly people leave within the first couple of years - Executives like pocketing more money for themselves while lower level employees face minimal salary raises (if we get salary raises) - Lack of transparency across the board (i.e. we learn of salary freezes, 401k cuts, layoffs, etc. through news outlets) - The younger generation knows this industry is not sustainable and views Exxon as the most evil compared to its peers - Communications on serious issues (i.e. COVID, BLM, Anti-Asian rhetoric) are purely reactive and are put out there as a response to employee dissatisfaction - Working from home for non-essential roles was not an option, even as peers contracted COVID-19. The company's scapegoat was ""they likely were exposed during their lunch break"" since the exposure could not be ""proven"" to occur during the 12-person meeting in the conference room (note this was before vaccines were rolled out). - Everything is an ""emergency"" in the eyes of management and they will drain your energy preparing for minute issues - Overall lack of diversity that will continue to propagate discriminatory behavior and microaggressions throughout the company - ""This is the way we've always done it, so we will continue doing everything this way"" will get you rewarded rather than challenging the status quo - The CEO and other executives only care about shareholders, never the individual contributors - Town Halls will actively censor messages and questions - ""Management's hands are tied"" is the excuse that is communicated for everything - Roles will continue to be outsourced abroad to save costs, despite the additional complications with timely communications - Management will not admit that they a culture revamp to retain talent - Talent is escaping to industries that better value their employees (i.e. Tech & Consulting), but Exxon will not enhance their benefits package accordingly - Only Chemical Engineering degrees are truly valued in the company. This is a not-so-secret expectation on how to quickly accelerate your career here. - Sustainability initiatives are minimal - In order to be successful, you are required to follow a traditional career path through manufacturing roles - If you do something bad, supervisors will not support you. If you do something good, supervisors will take credit for the work you did. - The expectation is that you need to respond within 24 hours if someone needs you while on vacation - The cultural issues stem throughout the entire company! Not only within one function (i.e. chemicals vs. upstream or supply chain vs. technical) - A supervisor once told me ""the people who do well here take ownership,"" which is ironic considering that the company as a whole has not been taking ownership over its poor culture that has caused top talent to apply elsewhere.

82;ExxonMobil;2021-08-26;Law Department;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Limited growth opportunity and rigorous competitive ranking system for all professionals;"Good place for experience. Lots of good co-workers. Very diverse and woke culture. Benefits are not excellent like they used to be but are still ok. Good place to be from. Looks great on a resume.
";"Opportunities for promotion are limited except for the top 20% of the rank group. Forced, competitive ranking for all professionals, while system is made to look objective is remains highly subject to preferential assignment opportunities, and subjective ranking largely influenced by whether you're in favor with the ranking management. Talent, hard work, amount of work product, quality of work, are not the main determinants of success. Sadly, having the ""right"" corporate appearance and image carry more weight in long-term success than technical or professional skills and production. For most employees, raises are mere cost of living adjustments. The few in the top get the vast lions share of promotions and advancement. The lower half of the rank group will get virtually nothing annually and maybe a one percent raise every 18 months to two years. Notwithstanding the fact that everyone they hire is an academic and professional standout just to get hired in the first place. The company is a morale killer. Stock has not performed and has lost value for over ten years running. The company is in decline.

103;ExxonMobil;2021-08-17;Business Controls Advisor;Current Employee, more than 8 years;It used to be a decent company;"I worked in Controllers organization and you will get lot of opportunities to learn the business. I've done financial reporting, operations accounting, process and controls, internal audit. Generally the rotation is about 3 years on average. You can't get bored but you have to learn fast. XOM has great expat policy and have great expat opportunities as well, if you're lucky to get on the list.
";"Management sucks. In my 20 years career in XOM I had just few great managers who were developing their personnel. There is lots of politics and brown-nosing. Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same. Salary increase is minimum to none, company match gone (they are going to reinstate it back in October), health plan is expensive, 401K funds are low performers. Bad time for energy sector but board members did get their bonuses. Why?

Even then, ExxonMobil was mistaking correlation with causality — their success then was despite their actions, not because of them. 4. A culture of fear. 5. Stacked rankings. 6. Overall, the work is mostly entirely meaningless and without any impact. This is not something you’ll want to tell your grandchildren about. 7. 90% of decision are made in Dallas, Houston and all other small offices are just there to push paper. 8.

";"The culture had been changing for the better for a while and then with Covid and the tough economy, leaders went back to old, poor behaviors and it's become a very toxic place. Leadership is really struggling with their vision and what they want to be, I've never seen leaders get paid so much to do so little, and behave in ways that actively encourage people to leave. There's no vision currently and nobody asking people to stay, The ranking system gives mixed messages where you're not ranked well, but your supervisor says you're great; and it creates unintended and unhealthy behaviors.

133;ExxonMobil;2021-08-20;FLS;Current Employee, more than 5 years;The company is going down the drain, clearly preparing for a future merger/acquisition with Chevron.;"The initial pay is fine. The matching savings plan is coming back for the foreseeable future. It’s a great name on the resume and will take you far. Great way to change companies.
";"Toxic culture. Toxic supervisors/managers cover for toxic supervisors/managers. The ghost layoffs are masked under the new ranking process to force employees out of the company. A ranking system that is used to layoff employees, particularly those new, older age or with the company for over 10 years. Compensation does not keep up with inflation or cost of living. Be prepared to deal with HR incompetence when trying to get a straight answer about ranking results. Company is a house of cards that will not change with the times/move swiftly like tech companies for example. It’s an imploding dinosaur. First and second line supervisors are not screened properly. Which is why the company becomes a breeding ground for a toxic micro cultures all across the company, up to the very top. There’s great managers out there but they usually can’t do much to stop the fires or poison seeping to other areas of the company. It’s a sad story. Once mighty Exxon, it has become a sad story of fallen giant. Its internal culture is a mirror image of the public’s toxic perception of the company. People should continue leaving. Other companies pay better and promote employees all throughout their career.

";"Exxon is very quick to let you know where you stand.

";"And I will quote a senior manager during a ranking session a few years ago “why is everyone so fussed about this process. It’s just about salary administration”. Flash forward a couple of years and I guess what he meant is administration of no salary upon layoffs of highly capable people. The desire to cling to an early 1900s management philosophy of fear and punishment is driven by those who benefited from this system. The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry. There is a serious lack of vision and an attitude of “don’t worry it will all be fine” as it is clear the ship is sinking! I implore anyone considering hiring on to at least look at the stock price over the last 5 years. After recovering from COVID lows the downward trend is right where it has been for that period. That is an objective reflection of the dismal quality of senior leadership.

Old thinking - not terribly agile in today's business world - UNWILLING to even consider solar/Wind power as a viable option - claim to be an energy company - but really on oil and gas Arrogant - smartest guy in the room syndrome.

";"If it was possible, I would publish a 500 page paper on why not to work at ExxonMobil if you're in tech. Top 4: 1) Management is a joke. It truly felt they hired the least qualified people in so many areas of management. Terrible at relationships. Even more terrible with tech. Because they give you the option to ""switch roles ever couple of years"", your first line boss truly determines your future. If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them. I could hear my ranking slowly go down every time I asked to work from home.

";"This used to be a good to place to work, not the greatest company for innovation, creativity or teamwork but the trade off was a stable “hire to retire” culture with solid business fundamentals, focus on safety and the chance of working with experienced and solid professionals. Yes you had to deal with a ranking system that destroyed any attempt of having a collaborative environment, and culture was focused on following procedures and working for complying with internal audits instead of fostering new ideas and teamwork, but working hard was typically rewarded and you could count on a long term career… Everything dramatically changed the last couple of years, ranking system was redesigned to make it easier to place employees at the bottom, you could be a sustained good performer for 5+ years and suddenly end up being offered a 3 lay off package for having had a “bad year”. There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit. This has been a fundamental shift away from what used to be company core values, and a real shame. Unless this is your only option, I would discourage anyone to join EM at the moment.

Jun 7, 2021 - Financial Analyst in Houston, TX

Business Outlook
Pros
The salary is great and well above what one needs to live comfortably in Houston. Exxon claims they routinely monitor and compete with salary and benefits that competitors offer, although rumor has it that it is no longer the top 10%, but mid-range. The benefits are great. You can pay about half the amount for medical insurance if you complete a few tasks annually. You get four dental cleanings a year that are paid for. There is a DB pension plan in addition to a 401k match (assuming they bring it back). Paid maternity leave along with temporary disability. There is unrivaled growth potential, especially if you take initiative and demonstrate you are able to save the company money. They try to accommodate your career interests with open job opportunities. The Spring campus is beautiful and has a state-of-the-art gym, on site dentist, optometrist, food court, and other shops. Additionally, management tries to be flexible on days you have other personal commitments. I never had to worry about leaving early or working from home if I had a doctor's appointment, home delivery, etc.
Cons
They infamously suspended the 401k match at the peak of the coronavirus. It is made abundantly clear that working from home long-term is out of the question unless you have a job assignment that warrants it (e.g auditor) because they want you to utilize the campus and collaborate in-person. Upper management is extremely far-removed from the day-to-day tasks and issues, partially due to the fact that Exxon is such a huge company, but this can be a problem for recurring issues that to them might be minute, but to the average worker cause a lot of frustration and angst.

The company has the potential to make a lot of money as the price of oil rises and some of that money may return to employees in higher raises and increased training opportunities.
";"Jobs are being cut all over Europe, Canada, Singapore and the USA to move jobs to locations where costs are cheaper. People being hired in many of these locations do not have the same dedication to the company and realize that they make less so when you get a supervisor or manager from one of these countries when you work in the USA expect resentment. The management in the USA talked for years that people were hired for a career from college to retirement but they have pushed people out by increasing poor performers to as high as 10% in some years to avoid paying layoff packages. The company forced many people to retire. The company cares about employees only if they are cheap to pay. Early in a person's career they are identified to be a top performer and after that time you can fall from being a top performer but it is almost impossible to get into the top rankings each year once the company has decided your career level in your first few years at the company.

264;ExxonMobil;2021-04-25;Electrical Engineer;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Wide variety of roles with upward potential in technical leadership - rewarded more for strategy than competence.;"I like the higher salary than most electrical engineers can make in other manufacturing or utility industries. Electrical engineers get experience working with a wide range of equipment and voltages, from PLCs to motors/drives to HV switchgear, from maintenance and reliability, to design and power system modeling. There is a variety of increasingly-challenging roles available with broader reach for a rewarding career.
";"Exxonmobil is largely run by chemical engineers, they don't really care about power unless the lights go off. You become a jack of all trades, master of none. Any complex engineering work gets contracted out. Senior levels of engineering with global influence are a good old boys club that's hard to crack.

";"ALL decisions are made at the very very top so everyone underneath is just managing up. Performance management is forced distribution. Basically every employee is stacked against each other and the bottom 8% are offered a package to leave. This leads to a ton of anxiety with the workforce and makes daily life pretty terrible. There is nothing modern or progressive about the company. They don’t support work flexibility or remote work. It’s all very uptight and unpleasant.

";"The job is mind-numbingly simple and routine. Two of the supervisors and the lab manager are toxic to those that work under them, patronizing when honest feedback is given, and then act shocked when new hires and contractors don't last six months before moving on to better positions at other companies. Almost all benefits were cut last year while the company shareholder dividend was maintained, and no raises were given out. There is extremely low morale, but with current leadership, it is being ignored rather than addressed. Claims of the utmost focus on quality go out the window when production metrics are threatened. Constantly short-staffed due to high turnover rate (because of excessively low morale). Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for lab work; this facility is a dead end.

";"Terrible culture. One example; Employees found out that 401k’s matches were cut via online articles instead of from supervisors or even a company email. Just one instance of terrible management. People will do whatever they can to get ahead, including throwing others under the bus. Actually, there were plenty of people now in supervisory positions who climbed their way to the top by whatever means possible. Strict ranking system discourage helping peers and folks aren’t as likely to help unless they get some credit. All in all, terrible work environment. Most people I know who still work there are looking into leaving, which says a lot considering their salary/benefits/etc. very political and a lot of snakes in the grass that you need to constantly be on watch for.

";"ExxonMobil used to be progressive company, but that changed in recent years. People are treated like commodity. Little prospect for growth, but this is mostly due to old nature of Oil&Gas industry. During annual review you will be told generic lines by your supervisor to justify your rank if you are in the middle or bottom. Work culture is toxic and employees bad mouth each other just to get a head (i.e. dirty competition encouraged by the new management) If you are at early stages of your career, and smart, then I recommend putting your efforts in alternate companies and industries that have better chance of success.

";"Being a large organization, it takes time for ideas to be incorporated at a large level (i.e. needs to be formally presented to a VP after 38 PowerPoint revisions before forward traction) Although it’s now a rating system, the performance appraisal process still reeks of the former archaic forced-ranking system Formal and careful (i.e. careful not to offend the “wrong” person) culture discourages dissent and making mistakes (and thus rewards maintaining the status quo or supporting senior folks’ perspective) - i.e. change and challenging thoughts are less welcome than they could be Lack of transparency with career progression (i.e. no open posting/communication of available positions as well as general secrecy of next role(s)), which means employees are potentially not utilized to their best ability With the traditional, good ‘ol boys culture, continue to deal with inappropriate, inconsiderate, or offensive comments and unconscious bias With recent impact of low oil prices, COVID-19, parts of the corporation have been significantly reduced, questioning long-term job security for those roles (including roles whose positions are being outsourced)

";"Upper management is detached, reactive, and apparently incompetent. The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy. Finally, the brand is toxic and the company knows it.

This is serving as a detriment to the company in a commodity based market that must sink or swim. - The company truly values Engineers and Geoscientists, but all other functions are put at the wayside and contributions or ability to provide insight are not valued as they should be

";"Corporate is Shady, the systems and equipment are newer but seem to run on old software. They cut corners when they can and Charge out the roof for really cheap foods, drinks, and other goods, including gas and tobacco products. They don’t care if the product is expired, they want us to sell it if we can. And during Covid, if you have a HIPPA or another medical exemption to not wear a mask, we are supposed to kick you out of the store. Overall it’s all about the income, not about customer satisfaction or or happiness. Our pumps don’t read right. They short you. Or Tank Systems have faults every where. I know we don’t have what we need to be up to date or all the stuff to keep the place clean. Definitely feel like they cut corners on safety but not sure where other than the Tank Information Systems. Alarms are constantly going off in the tanks but they say they are faulty and not to worry about them. Just had a bunch of Water in the Diesel Tanks that the State Department (FINALLY!!!!) stepped in and shut down the sale of Diesel. And finally other than it’s usually hot in the store. The cooler is Definitely an OSHA violation, if not the entire store. The pay seems to not be stable. My checks as well as other employees seem to be jumping between constant number. One employee is jumping around $100 constantly on each paycheck. Something is definitely a miss here. Plus no benefits or discounts on store goods.

";"As a Person of Color, my time with ExxonMobil was quite stressful. Most of the people are great to work with but supervisors are mostly micromanagers, diversity is not their strongest suit. Lots of white males in upper management. Too much discrimination at the workplace, sutle but it's there. Some of the operators won't like you because you're a young engineer coming in to tell them how to do their job, it takes time and patience to build a connection with them but overall great people to work with. Lots of fake people go behind your back to talk bad about you. Work hours can be crazy, it's part of the job description that you have your work phone with you 24/7. Anyone at the plant can contact you so say bye to Work-Life balance. If you do have a doctor's appt. or so you can get time off or be allowed to come to work late, supervisors do differ. Work hours can be long, when you're new it's expected you're at the plant later than everyone getting to know your unit and operators. ExxonMobil has a ranking system every year to discuss your performance but if your supervisor doesn't like you, you won't have someone to defend your work and speak for you. They do allow you to have Knowledgable Others that can speak on your character and work ethics but your peers are competing with you so not a lot of people you can trust to speak highly of you. Advice: go to work do your job and work hard if you're a POC waiting for recognition don't count on it, your counterparts would get recognized before you. The supervisors secretly will give you more than you can do so you don't look good to management.

493;ExxonMobil;2021-02-09;Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Good times are past. Stay away.;"Sadly all the former pros are gone. There was a time I loved my job. Those days are past.
";"Management has no care or connection to the workforce and is moving jobs from “high cost” countries to India as fast as they can. No chance of a long term career. All benefits continue to be cut as time goes on. No raises. No 401k match. No cost of living adjustments. No education or training program. No opportunities. Entire workforce is looking for employment elsewhere. Very low morale. Fired so many people that you have to do the work of two people and work 12 hour days. Workforce does not trust management. No transparency from management on plans for continued workforce reduction. Very arbitrary good old boys ranking process for identifying who to fire during annual layoffs. Company is shrinking and in decline. Opportunities from promotion limited as company is laying off not growing.

Really value employees instead of just talking it. Bonus opportunities taken away for all except for select few. At one point all employees got stock options. Now only upper management.

";"Bartlesville quality of life. Supervisors and managers spend most of their time in meetings. The annual performance rating system ""calibration"" process boils down to favoritism and your supervisor's ability to advocate for you, rather than your actual contributions. Excessive random drug testing program that is skewed toward younger employees rather than the entire population. The company's safety fetish results in corporate employees being treated like children, where employees can tattle on other employees for not using handrails or crosswalks. The Bartlesville employee parking lot has a flashing speed limit sign/radar that captures your speed as you enter the parking lot and security guards regularly park in the lot in the mornings to watch for ""speeding"" employees.

";"My line of work is an important part of our company strategy, yet it is glaringly obvious management does not appreciate or understand it. Limited opportunities for growth. Handling of employees/in-office return in May 2020 (during pandemic) was disturbing. Workplace flexibility is non-existent; ""we are a work from work culture"", management is constantly shifted around and never become specialists, in my experience.
Advice to Management
Be open to new ideas instead of doing things the way they have always been done. Offer some sort of flexibility or work from home option, even as little as 1-2 days per month. Be transparent with decisions that involve employee health, ie: dismal handling of pandemic & return to office protocol.

Cultural shift underway. 

Moving to more outsourcing and management of contracts and less emphasis on people and career development. 

Current upper management has turned a blind eye towards several ethical violations and increasing attrition (including many key resources) is seen as collateral damage. 

Business strategy transformation is happening but nothing groundbreaking. AE66 has a great marketing campaign but real results are questionable.

Overall the company has both a strong business and people strategy, but leaders are not being held accountable to walk the talk.
Advice to Management
Need to think about how the nature of work is transforming and adapt accordingly. Asking employees to adapt to rapid change but not offering the same in return.

Company is self-insured thru BCBS, Aetna, or another provider depending on the location you're in. Great HSA or FSA health plan options. Excellent life insurance, long & short-term disability. Vacation days contingent on experience (10/yr if you're fresh out of college, add 5 days for every 5 years of experience). Add in a floating holiday and monthly ""19/30"" days that have to be used within the month. Some teams are excellent and it's entirely possible to have a wonderful set of immediate colleagues & supervisor.
";"IT leadership in shambles. CIO resigned, possibly because he was effectively made into a co-CIO with 5 or 6 other senior IT folks. Poor coordination, too many cooks in the kitchen. Lots of other senior or longstanding middle IT managers leaving the company, taking valuable historical knowledge with them. Lack of leadership makes it very difficult to get the ""easy wins"" done, like deploying out-of-the-box updates for standard applications. Stuff that should take 20 min can take 6 months, under the right mix of bad circumstances. 

2021 merit increases have been ""deferred"" indefinitely. Not a shocker considering the state of the industry. Haven't had layoffs to the extent of Exxon, BP, etc., but a few dozen people were let go in late 2020. Most teams in IT are already skeleton crews. Bonuses are expected to be drastically reduced this year, or eliminated entirely; normally they are 10% or more of salary.

Culture very oriented towards physical safety when I joined. That all went out the window when everyone was forced back to the office in May/June 2020. Hard to take the ""Hold the handrail"" rules seriously when mask-wearing is not enforced stringently. Working remotely is not an option for most corporate HQ staffs, even though many can and did work remotely with great success from March-May 2020. Understandably the situation is different at refineries, but those teams are also spread out over larger sites, which can make social distancing easier.

Appoint a CIO. Let that person have true authority and autonomy to orchestrate changes.

I think management is relaxed, which is nice. However, the more subtle issues like employee/contractor accountability is something needing addressed higher in the chain of things. Also being able to accurately note individual efforts and successes would greatly drive competitiveness among employees/contractors and justify moral.

207;Phillips66;2020-08-14;Operator/Technician;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Some great people but the company/job is not for everyone;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.


-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)

-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.


-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn

-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.

-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.
";"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. 

-The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). 


-Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?


-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...

-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". 

-There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.


-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. 


-The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""


-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.


-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".
Advice to Management
Stop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.

208;Phillips66;2020-07-10;Corporate Engineering Advisor;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Very Old School, Siloed, and Dysfunctional;"Benefits are good and above average. Good office building.
";"As an experienced hire, new views were not welcomed. The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.
Advice to Management
Be open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff. They might find out what is working and not working more.

";"This company is stuck in the 1960s and refuses to adapt to the times for some reason. With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.

There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.
Advice to Management
Your refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.

Advice to Management
Seriously take a look a performance reviews and helping employees establish a career path. You have requirements to perform reviews take them serious. Provide good feedback with emphasis on good items, bad items and needed areas of improvement. Don’t tell employees that they are doing a good job and keep doing what you are doing. Go into detail.

Phillips 66 will pay for your CPA study materials and reimburse you for all 4 parts of your CPA exam! The best part is you don’t have to have a CPA to be an accountant with this company. Wonderful team atmosphere with management that supports your goals.
";"As of now (not counting COVID-19 era) Phillips 66 doesn’t support working remotely. There may be a change eventually, but I don’t think it will happen soon.

";"Most managers don't have working spouses so company is not very family friendly. If your kid is sick you take a vacation day. Yet, salaried people are required to respond to emergencies 24/7 without pay as well as being on call for work support 24/7. You may support an incident in the middle of the night or weekend with a 8-12 hour window without compensation. There's a few jobs that senior employees can do outside of Corp HQ but those opportunities are only provided a few select key males. Males seem to be promoted more readily than females with similar skill sets. Also, although there are more and more female employees in technical roles I won't share my job title or location. I can easily figure out who posted review for other locations since there aren't that many females in Tech roles.
Advice to Management
Try to be competitive with not only O&G industry but other industries. Money is made in the facilities, not Corp office. Give more support to sites where the work is actually happening. The money spent for the waterfall in the Corp HQ office could have gone to better use in the field.

234;Phillips66;2019-10-27;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Good start;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). 

Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. 

Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.
";"Limited vacation time (usually 10 days), but the company does have 10 dedicated holidays (Christmas, etc). Also, some jobs are eligible for the ""19/30"" program, which gives you an extra day off each moth so long as you work 8.5 hours per day (instead of 8 - up to you if you'd want to do that in any given month).
Advice to Management
Don't do away with the long-term benefits like the pension system; it's what brings good people in and keeps them around.

";"Typical corporate America culture, nothing special here. For me, this was a con. For some, that's okay. Experience can vary drastically depending on manager. There are great ones and there are awful ones that have no business leading people. The reason I left the company is because I had an awful supervisor that was only looking after themselves. Don't expect this environment to be conducive for young professionals looking to make a difference. It can be quite stagnant at times (during the downturns and up swings). Experience can also vary drastically depending on where you are located, such as the corporate headquarters or a business unit (BU). I spent time in both, and prefer the culture in the BU, by far.

I've never had any resistance to have to take time off or leave the office temporarily to take care of life stuff. Relaxed work environment. Very flexible work schedule. Lots of bonus activities going on. Pot-lucks, work picnics, holiday parties. Houston office is very nice.
";"The ceiling for how technical you can get into software development is fairly low, if that matters to you. Although they have SPIRIT values that encourage everyone to follow certain values. The compensation system passively encourages you to make make your peers look worse to allow you to look better and get a better raise. Not remote work friendly. Business Casual when it is basically unneeded. Many employees are very resistant to change. As of Dec. 2019 the Bartlesville office could use a refresh especially compared to the brand new Houston office.

As everywhere, there are occasional people who only care about themselves, what's in it for them, how it makes them look, etc. With good navigation they can often be avoided.
";"When prices are low formal training opportunities vanish. Old-school culture and management values employees who tow the line, and who mimic and parrot. The status quo is that the company sheds about 5 - 10% of employees every 2-3 years on average. When prices are low, the cuts are much more significant and frequent. Fewer career opportunities as assets are shed during the downturn.

316;Conocophilips;2017-02-21;Geologist;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Oil and Gas Exploration;"The company has strong heritage assets, and may kind caring people. There are many smart talented people. However, overarching corporate vision and smart business decision making are lacking. The work scheduling with every other friday off schedule is fantastic. I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff. Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.
";"Politics, bureaucracy, bloated, games. Let me give a disclaimer that I was laid off. While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game. Reason is, these people are still employed and will be the next set of managers in the next 5 years... the cycle continues.

They treat their employees well, at least when commodity prices are high. When ConocoPhillips was an integrated oil company, there were opportunities to do a wide variety of work all over the world including upstream, downstream, and midstream.
";"It is a large company, so things tend to move slowly, and you have to follow some crazy rules. The oilfield is also not a fun place to work when times are bad. And after the company split into upstream and downstream components, ConocoPhillips continues to specialize more and more on Lower 48 shale plays. This may be a good business decision, but it limits career opportunities for mechanical engineers.

Corporate culture is positive, it seems that people here generally care about you, benefits are industry competitive. Good location in Energy Corridor, beautiful complex, and great onsite gym, medical and dental clinics, cafeteria.
";"Because they promote from within, you will find some managers that are truly ill-equipped to be in management. The company did not position itself very well to weather the oil price downturn through means other than headcount reduction. The Executive level decision to not hedge crude oil production as an independent E & P company because it is a ""zero sum game"" is considered by many to be the riskiest strategy of all.

New hires go through a rotation program in which they change their job every 15 months or so. This gives exposure to different types of jobs and the ability to learn significantly more skills as a result. The people are super friendly and everyone is supportive of each other's success. ;"dering how poorly oil is doing it's incredible how well new hires and interns are treated. The intern program is fantastic. They have another ""job fair"" once you start the internship for your exact position, giving you many options of what you'd like to spend the summer doing. There's all sorts of fun events throughout the summer for interns. They have summer rumble, which is a competition between new hires and interns (via volleyball, basketball, trivia nights, etc.) that goes on throughout the entire summer. They take you on a trip to Houston on the company plane to visit the Houston campus - we also spent an evening at Top Golf when we went there.

Layoffs. Though it seems like new hires are pretty much immune. I was an IT Intern. As a CS major, some of the opportunities within the company seem limited being that this is not a tech company.

425;Conocophilips;2016-06-24;Financial Planner and Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Incredible Culture;"COP has a very collaborative culture that encourages employees to learn from each other and share knowledge that improves processes. Having 9/80 schedules are also a great benefit, however depending on the group you are in the flexibility may or may not be there. COP has a great retirement package- 401K match AND pension. For finance there is a rotational program so you are constantly being exposed to new things.
";"There are a lot of requests that take a lot of time to put together, but are required to be put together quickly. Requests for scenarios is not a bad thing, but when you are running a scenario on everything under the sun that just gives someone peace of mind instead of driving decision making it can be exhausting for the people at the bottom.

System integrations have reduced the silo effect between departments thereby reducing project delays and budget wars during declining revenue. Department management uses all tactics available to protect department budgets which included department staff.
";"The decline in oil and gas prices have affected the company as per all companies with exploration and production (upstream) operations. ConocoPhillips spun off refining into a new company they named Phillips 66, thereby losing revenue in the more stable downstream market where jobs typically pay less for equivalent years of experience but with less layoffs.

";"The problem is the lower management levels can be filled with people that you have to wonder how they got the job, then you realize the good ole boy system is how. If you aren't in the cool kids club you are definitely out. I watched people get promoted and get raises based on nothing more than how much they were liked by mgmt but that is probably true most everywhere. The company hit some hard times lately due to the drop in oil so I understand the frozen salaries the last few years and the drop in benefits (which are still good). The CEO should realize he isn't above sacrificing though, big raises and bonuses sour the employee's mood when they get nothing and are laid off.

";"The prior CEO was less than competent when it came to succession management and leadership development; his constant firing and churning of the upstream leadership and risk aversion led to sub-optimized investment performance. As a result of the $34B writedown of 2009, he was named the worst CEO of the first decade of this century by Business Week magazine. Rightly so. He paid too much for assets (he preferred to by oil & gas reserves since he couldn't find any), ran off talented middle & senior level management, dis-incentivized the organic development of new assets (hasn't found any new oil in 16 years), developed no deepwater capabilities, alienated petroleum engineers and geologists, kept investment strategy secret (even to his own staff), sold off valuable assets, kept lousy assets despite good offers and split the integrated company right before the inevitable cyclical downturn of the oil & gas industry. This has left a husk of an upstream company which is incapable of operating like a smaller independent oil company, is struggling to retain what little talent is left and is scraping for investment cash flows (cut the dividend last month).

All the areas where they are wasting money will never go away, because all the people who dreamed it up are still in leadership and simply not capable of letting go. Cronyism thrives at COP and the best opportunities and performance ratings are saved for the cronies. Ability to survive in low commodity price environment is questionable. Cronyism and corporate politics is comparably chronic and extreme. Leadership moves frequently and it is rare for a Business Unit leader to be at a location more than two years.

Culture was great, though low-commodity pricing has lowered employee morale and the way employees truly used to care for one another (people do crazy things just to keep the job).
";"From the beginning of the year, the low commodity pricing has had a HUGE impact on the company. From the company withholding annual raises, retention bonuses, promotions, relocations, etc all in the name of not having to do layoffs, the company STILL conducted multiple layoffs. The first round supposedly was based on performance, but it has become evident though other rounds that it is surely a game of politics--with those having good relationships with people of power sticking around and those who don't (despite great performance and high ratings) being let go. It is now a high stress environment, with those of us remaining not knowing our fate. There are certainly good people still around, if you happened to be in the right place (group still actively performing work) at the right time, but there are many people still present who most certainly should be gone.

Older colleagues were welcoming, patient and willing to spend time with the new-hire engineers to get them up to speed. The salary and benefits I considered generous.
";"Once it became clear that layoffs were impending, we all lived under this threat for many, many months and the stress affected work and relationships. These circumstances are not unique to this company, but the manner in which layoffs were conducted here was particularly brutalizing and insensitive and the decisions concerning who stayed and who was laid off seemed particularly arbitrary, i.e. some very strong, motivated performers were shown the door while some mediocre talents remained. My lasting impression is that shareholders are of singular importance whereas employees are expendable...a very shortsighted approach. Not all companies take this view.

Many Supply Chain Management new hires forfeited alternative offers due to this developmental program. Management has not delivered on their promises to grow and rotate their new hires/personnel. Many sit in the same roles year after year after year not growing and not developing. Some of the new hires are given preferential treatment due to political connections and are moved around frequently. The rest of the new hires are left to sit in their positions.

";"In the recent downturn, they layed a lot of people off only to hire back just as many because they didn't want to go back on their offers.

602;Conocophilips;2015-06-18;Senior Reservoir Engineering Technician L48-East;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Sr. Reservoir Engineering Technican;"ConocoPhillips is a wonderful company to work for. I have worked here for a very long time and it has truly grown over the years; even with the ups and downs in the oil business. Conoco still continues to be #1 in the industry in my opinion. I have always been treated well here, respected by my peers, and been able to work hard and contribute what I know to be a proactive part of any team, voice my opinion, and help to streamline processes where I can. I love the fact that even though I am assigned to a specific team, I have the freedom to branch out and help just about any team that needs my help! I learn a lot from others by having this type of freedom and I can still support the people I work for and help others as well.
";"The oil market overall is and has been downsizing for some time now due to pricing. That is the scary part of working in this business. You never know if you are going to be laid off or not in the next round of layoffs. It's a very devastating feeling that lingers in your mind and it does affect you. I don't care what anyone says it's on just about every person's mind as we go through these hard times. I was around in the 80's/90's when we went through this then and have seen hundreds of my co-workers laid off. I have some friends that were laid off in 2014 that still cannot find work. Good people, hard workers. It's very sad.

The people in Bartlesville were great. Really enjoyed the culture of the company. Very open, very positive. Core hours are 9-3, but as long as you are there during those hours you can come in and leave whenever you want so long as you get your 9 hours in. Very helpful on days when you have appointments or travel and want to leave a couple hours early.
";"Part of the reason they pay so well is because people don't want to be in Bartlesville, OK. It is a nice small town if you have a family and want to settle down. But for the younger generation, it just doesn't have much to offer. The flexible schedule is nice, but when you have to travel outside of town to do most fun stuff, it gets a little old. If you have grown up in larger cities, the town will definitely be an adjustment.

Phenomenal benefits. IT has a very low stress working environment compared to more ""tech"" oriented companies. Great place for someone looking to settle down, start a family, and embrace the ""work to live, not live to work"" mentality. This is definitely an organization ran by an older generation. Bartlesville really can be a great place to live if you learn to make the most of it. Job security is unmatched.
";"As with any large corporation, ConocoPhillips moves slowly and has its fair share of bureaucracy. In my experience, the IT organization is more oriented towards those wanting to settle down than those wanting to move up or do something incredibly progressive. There is significant internal resistance to making waves. Employees are encouraged to keep their head down and follow directions. New ideas generally take around two years to implement. Budget cycles control the fate of most projects. If the oil price drops, almost all ""new"" IT projects will be frozen for the year.

";"- The leadership in my department once told me that we do not make counteroffers to employees that have received a better offer for another company. Seems pretty foolish - Average raises usually are around 3.5 - 4.0 percent (can be more depending on rating) - Some departments like to ""spread the wealth"" so they will alter who gets the 1 and 2 ratings each year. For example, if you get a promotion in 2012, you would automatically get the standard 3 rating that year. It is very rare to get a 1 or 2 rating two years in a row even if you do the best work. - HR has just as much of a say as your supervisor/director does on when you get promoted. - Promotions are just 6%. I know for a fact that this is not the case at CHK or Devon. - We don't find the oil, we just follow everybody else to it.

754;Conocophilips;2012-03-20;;Current Employee;Mediocre place for a career;"At ConocoPhillips, in most work groups the work/life balance is pretty good: if you need time off for vacation or if you are sick, supervisors are usually very understanding. The benefits (health, vision, perscription) are very good and there is a big push toward over-all wellness (physical, mental). Very nice gym facility at the main complex and a lot of outside programs to get involved in. (Rodeo Run, United Way, Employee Networks)
";"There are many layers of management at ConocoPhillips and that makes it extremely hard to get any work done or to feel any sense of ownership of a role. While it is possible to get a new role and develop professionally at ConocoPhillips, there are a lot of politics at play and there are Talent Management Teams (TMT's) that play a huge role in placing employees in new roles that are not always in the employees best interest and development, it's usually for the benefit of the company. Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees. Most of the poor treatment of employees comes from top management and employees are seen as very expendable.

";"The usual issues that come with a large corporation. Too much ""red tape"" and communication between departments is often lacking. The upcoming split (into two separate companies) appears to be driven by the desire to create one rather lucrative company and one company designed to absorb all of the negative feedback from the press and the EPA. This is great for stockholders but about half of the company employees will take a difficult turn as a result. These reasons appear self-absorbed and reflect a cut-throat attitude.

759;Conocophilips;2012-01-06;Intern;Former Employee;Very bureaucratic and not diverse;"Good pay. Intern program is alright. Could've been much better, but the Finance and IT interns had it much better since they had a good HR manager. You get to meet a lot of people through Lunch n Learns. The problem is, the interns started separating a bit, with the finance group hanging with themselves, procurement with themselves, etc. Yet there were a fair number of interns who organized and attended social events outside of work hours.
";"Bartlesville is not very exciting. Corporate bureaucracy is very very evident. VP of HR even said something along the lines of: ""you'll be promoted based on how you are perceived...."" COP barely hires outside of Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Texas. So if you're coming from the north or anywhere else, you'll be alone. For any prospective interns out there, this may all change after I write this because of the split. But I doubt there's going to be any culture changes. It's probably going to be the same boring corporate company like any other.

";"The Bartlesville, Oklahoma office houses a sprawling bureaucracy which administers the IT, Finance, and Accounting functions. The culture is extremely risk-averse. The Orwellian office-safety campaign reflects an unwillingness to quantify risk, rather than a sincere commitment to worker safety. The computer systems line employees interface with are 10-20 years out of date. The staffing model, driven by seniority and cronyism, promotes uneducated legacy employees beyond their level of competence. The Tone at the Top, both in corporate management and business unit management, is focused on control, constricting employee autonomy and stifling innovation. Decision making is paralyzed by fear of risk. While the pay is above market, the opportunities are decidedly limited. Any college finance course will teach you that an option is worth money. ConocoPhillips knows this, and pays employees a premium for the options they forgo due to the remote work location and glacial pace of promotions.

It appears that software we end up supporting/developing has more to do with the person who yells the loudest, rather than what is truly useful or innovative.

The company likes to build traders up in their mold and are in no rush to have you do so (the one exception may be with the power traders where you start off as either a scheduler or 24-hour trader).

818;Conocophilips;2009-07-15;;Current Employee;Terrible Work Culture;"It is a Job for now
";"Management by fear and intimidation.Very poor culture to work in. In all my years with this company I have never seen the morale so low. Forced to move to Houston so we could be close to our commercial group as we weret told. Our group never talks to Commercial. They are splitting families up and have no regard for peoples lives.
"
819;Conocophilips;2009-07-13;Analyst;Current Employee;Review Management Techniques;"The benefits and salary are unmatched.
";"Management Style; Negative Reinforcement. Mgmt Staff does not take any responsibility for new hire support or cross training; it is required, and it is, ""get-it-yourself"". Friendliness is strictly prohibited.

820;Conocophilips;2009-05-29;;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips - Challenging and rewarding Refinery Engineering positions;"Challenging opportunities and a dynamic work environment keep the job interesting and always changing. Also, teamwork is required but is very rewarding as well.
";"Working in a 24/7 operation calls for being on call some nights and weekends and can hamper plans you had when things go wrong at the plant.
"

"
822;Conocophilips;2009-04-24;Intern;Current Employee;Intern loves job;"Good benefits, flextime, great pay, and the people are all very easy to get along with. It is definitely a place you will love or hate. Everyone that I came in contact with treated me as a coworker and not as in intern. I was also given a real task, which was a big deal to me. I did not want to get coffee for people are summer long, regardless of pay. Conoco puts a strong emphasis on not encroaching into your personal time, so you don't have to worry about working at home.
";"No outstanding downsides that you don't find everywhere else. Some people may not like the social atmosphere, but that is fine.
"
823;Conocophilips;2009-04-28;Analyst;Current Employee;Not for everybody, but could be worse.;"Access to great training opportunities, co-workers are very sharp and a pleasure to work with.
";"Managemnt across the board seems fairly archaic in their management philosophy. It becomes very apparent that you're living in a ""Phillips"" world after a few short months.
"
824;Conocophilips;2009-04-02;;Current Employee;Experience at ConocoPhillips;"The people at ConocoPhillips are very friendly and willing to help others out. They offer a lot of opportunities to individuals that are just coming out of college. There are many ways to learn more about the industry and see whether or not it is a good fit. ConocoPhillips also has great compensation and everyone seems to be very excited to work there. You are constantly challenged to apply everything you have learned into your work and have the guidance of the other employees. Overall, I would definitely recommend individuals to look at this company and consider it as an option.
";"There are not many downsides to working at ConocoPhillips. The only thing I can think of is the fact that the headquarters are located in Texas, which is not my ideal location to work at. I also think that the company is pretty big so it may feel like you can get lost, but as long as you take the initiative to suceed and ask questions, the size of the company won't really get to you. ConocoPhillips offers a lot to its employees and it is up to the individual to pave their own path and create their own experience.
"
825;Conocophilips;2009-03-25;Stillman;Current Employee;Not great but I wouldn't change.;"Pay is pretty good compaired to other companies. The work is reasonable for the pay and they offer the normal package of incentives, health insurance, 401K etc. Like the military there is two groups, officers and enlisted or hourerly and salary. Most of the time it seems we work against each other all the while promoting team work. All of the hourly work in a very tight team work organization but are often interupted by management (salaried) to do some bonehead idea. Unfortunately there is no oversight on them so no matter how bad they mess up they keep their job. Hourly not so much, mess up too much and your gone.
";"Your just a number, not treated as a person.
"
826;Conocophilips;2009-03-06;GIS Business Analyst;Current Employee;Company with potential.;"Stability. Money is alright as well.
";"Management can't seem to root out the weeds. The wrong people are promoted and aren't held accountable for bad behaviors and inaction. The company needs to take a good long look at how employees are treated and how they are not being satisfied.
"
827;Conocophilips;2009-02-20;Employee;Current Employee;Fair Compensation?;"Job Security is great. Work is satisfying.
";"To sign a contract with the labor unions with a 3% increase and $2500 signing bonus and then freeze salary increases for non-union is absolutely horrid. Nothing like a kick in the teeth for those of us on the salary side. As far as severences go, there are more than 4% of the workforce that have very little contribution to the quality of the company. In our facility alone, I could easily point out 20% that we could do without and still get by.
"
828;Conocophilips;2009-02-18;;Current Employee;Senior Management takes MILLIONS in VCIP payouts while laying off hundreds of employees.;"It's a horrid economy, so it's great to have a job
";"Individuals are unable to control their own career. Senior Mgmt participates and waists nearly 2 months of the year in ""people planning"" activities trying to direct the careers of their reports. Sadly, positions that are posted have already been spoken for by the Senior Mgmt team. This is contrary to the actual communication to the employee which says that they are to take charge and own their career by filling out their Individual Development Plan and post for positions that make sense. Sadly, employees with appropriate skill sets are passed over because they didn't graduate from the right University Graduate program
"
829;Conocophilips;2009-02-17;Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips - A Good Company with Potential To Be Great!;"It is a large reputable company which is more stable than many of the smaller independents oil and gas companies
";"Upper management is from financial side of the business and are therefore more interested in stock price than in long term sustainability. They continuously cut corners to improve the bottom line without regard to the long term effects. Similarly, like most other majors, they are not being proactive in transitioning from an oil/gas company into a energy company that includes renewables. Most of their alternative energy work is fundamentally based on hydrocarbons. There is also a significant dissention between the heritage Conoco and heritage Phillips employees. This feud has been the basis for many poor decisions that have been made in the past.
"
830;Conocophilips;2009-01-26;Lead Prod Coordinator;Current Employee;Great company to work for;"above average salary and superior benefits. Company is still structured like the companies of olden times where you get monthly profit sharing and you see a running balance of your account value plus they match your stock savings at a minimum of 8 bucks for every dollar invested plus your 401 match is more cream on top. i got back vacation i lost from other employers and then some. on top of all of that there is a day off each month for personal time so you can easily have 6-7 weeks of time off a year. now who does that?
";"stagnant management not up to speed with the now.
"
831;Conocophilips;2009-01-25;Senior Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips is a GREAT place to work!;"Good growth opportunities, good salaries, safety, fairness
";"Even though my company is very fair, the oil and gas industry is still a 'man's' industry. They are promoted more.
"
832;Conocophilips;2009-02-16;Senior Analyst;Current Employee;Beware of ConocoPhillips as a potential employer.;"There are no reasons to work for ConocoPhillips.

";"If you come in as a seasoned professional you will not have the same opportunities as the young (out of college) professionals. There is a small town mindset with a huge amount of nepotism

";"Almost always have to put in more than 40 hours a week to complete job expectations.
"
836;Conocophilips;2008-11-27;Process Engineer;Current Employee;Come to ConocoPhillips;"It is a good time to start your career with COP. There is a large population that is nearing retirement so there will be plenty of opportunities for career advancement. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are generally pretty good too. There is no shortage of work, so if you like to be busy then you should look at this company. There are a lot of highly skilled folks that generally like to engage the younger workforce and assist in their development - which is a big plus. There is also a lot of construction activity going on at my site so you can be pretty confident about career longevity and job security.
";"I'm sure there are any.
"
837;Conocophilips;2008-12-08;Financial Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips, a large company with its ups and downs.;"ConocoPhillips has good benefits and total compensation. They have a 19/30 program where if you work an extra 30 minutes a day, you can take 1 free comp day off a month. This adds 12 paid days a year to the already generous vacation package. ConocoPhillips has on-site, top-notch fitness facilities free of charge to employees. They have a lot of opportunities.
";"Since ConocoPhillips is such a large company, it is easy to be overlooked. There are so many people, it is sometimes difficult to feel like you are actually making a difference and contributing to something. It is very difficult to get involved/interact with upper management. It seems like there is a lot of red tape to go through.
"
838;Conocophilips;2008-11-05;Analyst;Current Employee;Jim Mulva is an amazing leader;"The Houston complex is being renovated and is very nice. The fitness center is world class! The credit union is on site and very convenient. Excellent employer for people early in their careers as there is a great deal of focus on developing young talent.
";"Many locations are undesirable. The move to a open, 'pod' work environment is a negative - very difficult to focus on work while listining to the conversations of others. Experience is not always valued.
"
839;Conocophilips;2008-10-17;Senior Engineering Technician;Current Employee;A good company to start out at.;"OK pay & benefits - most of the managers I've had have been easy to get along with
";"OK pay & benefits - you can go to just about any independant and get better pay. Mulva takes his $50 million but certainly isn't spreading it around any. A lot of my peers (in other companies) have been getting 30%+ bonuses while COP was giving 7-14%. Recently a 20% retention bonus was given to some engineers in some BU's and not others and a 5% raise given to US based employees but not to expats. It certainly upset a lot of people - not that it mattered to me, techs never get anything anyway.
"
840;Conocophilips;2008-09-24;Intern;Former Employee;Good company, good pay, great benefits, nice people.;"Good benefits package, very nice people and comfortable office.
";"From what I have heard, career advancement may be more subjective depending on how well you fit in to the culture instead of being based more on individual performance.
"
841;Conocophilips;2008-09-21;Analyst;Current Employee;great company overall;"Great benefits, higher than average remuneration, leadership is generally accessible in the lower cadres, but become less so higher up in the organization. access to a worldwide workforce and experience from experts in several countries. very high levels of job security,
";"lots of process, decision making can be slow. Sometimes tasks are divided among many resulting in less than optimal levels of challenge

"
843;Conocophilips;2008-08-21;Finance and Accounting Director/Manager;Current Employee;The Best Oil Major in the Industry--Publicly held at least.;"Great focus as a company. We are all pulling in the same direction. I feel that we are providing quality products, providing energy for our country in a very responsible manner. I could not be more proud of a more ethical company.
";"For me there probably are no more advancements due to age (over 50). Our focus is on the young as it should be--however I'm afraid we have lost sight of our best experience. We have a huge disconnect between the generations. Our industry suffered greatly in the 80's and 90's so we really have a great number of folks too young and inexperienced to take the reins from us in management.
"
844;Conocophilips;2008-08-20;Analyst;Current Employee;Happy to be at COP;"Dynamic energy company with lots of growth opportunities. It seems like there are always new jobs posted on the internal web site. Headquarters in an easy-to-get-to Houston location, not in downtown. Benefits are fair, especially when it comes to retirement and savings -- pension, 401k and stock thrift are hard to beat. Salaries may be slightly lower than average.
";"The ""old-timers"" talk about the differences between Conoco and Phillips. This is sometimes disheartening to hear, especially when you hear of the frequency of rewards for a job well done in the old days. Recognition and performance feedback seem to be lacking. Probably true for most companies though with the litigious society we live in.
"
845;Conocophilips;2008-08-17;Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips is a great safe place to work for both family oriented and non-family oriented people.;"The people at ConocoPhillips are great to work with. You don't feel like you're just a number. At most companies, you feel like there are revolving doors with people constantly leaving, but that is not the case here. If you're in the finance or most other aspects of the company, you don't have to live in the ""big"" city for your ""big break."" There are plenty opportunities right here in Bartlesville and it's a good place to raise children and have a family. Higher ranking officers from the corporate office even drop by to your office from time to time and come to each person's individual desk to talk to you to get feedback. On top of all that, the company has GREAT PAY and WONDERFUL BENEFITS. The company is always looking for more ways to improve and satisfy its employees. So far, it has been a great company to work for.
";"I have not experienced any downsides yet since I've been with the company and I don't expect to experience any. I've enjoyed everyday at work and the jobs are challenging, but not too challenging to the point where they can't be completed.

847;Conocophilips;2008-07-26;Analyst;Current Employee;Go COP;"Compensation is good. Locations around the world. Some chance for advancement. Company is making lots of money - as long as the government keeps their hands out of it. Lots of good people. If you are a hard worker you will be compensated well. If you are an average worker you will still be overpaid. If you're a louzy worker they will keep you around anyway. Once your on the payroll it is hard to get rid of people. Have some good locations to work at. Big city (Houston) or smaller towns (Farmington NM). Great variety. Bigger office have good work out facilities.
";"Understaffed - Understaffed - Understaffed. Get locked in to a job you are good at. And suddenly no more chances for advancement. Got to wonder were middle managment comes up with some of their ideas. Can be cases of the ""buddy system"" at work. Company catering to the new hires - making what appears to be unrealistic expectations for each and every one fo the new hires. At the same time telling the old guys (that do most of the work) that we've got to work smarter not harder. Sometimes they penny pinch and don't give the tools that are needed to do the job. But the biggest thing is that 10% of the people do 90% of the work.
"
848;Conocophilips;2008-06-11;Senior Software Engineer;Current Employee;A Leader in the Industry;"Leader in the industry. Great opportunity for professional development. The Employee morale is great probably because of record oil prices. ConocoPhillips does a terrific job of incenting employees though stock incentives. The leadership is second to none and the opportunity is great as long as you are willing to be flexible geographically
";"Much is expected. Many hours are required. In order to advance you need to be flexible geographically. Many of the places where oil is located is inhospitable, but you know that going in.
"
849;Conocophilips;2008-06-12;Operations Engineer;Current Employee;Wood River Refinery pays well, but fails to have a good work-life balance for its employees.;"The high salary, the chance to make changes that have a lot of monetary value.
";"The lack of work/life balance. I worked 45 days straight of 10-12 hour days and only got 5 days of comp time. However, getting any comp time is atypical. Typically no comp time is given for having to work late or on weekends. The lack of business sense is frustrating. We spend a lot of time trying to save money and do the bare minimum to fix the problem. Then shortly thereafter we have to spend twice the money and time to reapply the band aid. Then we go on to the next fire to fight.
"
850;Conocophilips;2008-06-11;Technical Service Engineer;Current Employee;Working here has pluses and minuses;"You have the opportunity to take your career in many different directions. (Jobs are posted internally, but like most job-hunting networking is important.) Most people seem to have a good work-life balance. There is a lot of talk about alternative energy and developing new technology, which is exciting.
";"The work processes are pretty weak (relative to an ExxonMobil, for example). This allows flexibility, but also causes a lot of confusion about how to get things done and what goals are most important. Senior managers are strong, but middle management is decidedly lacking. People follow seemingly random career paths and frequntly do not have the skills and knowledge they need to manage the group below them very effectively.

Thankfully there are not very many a**holes and that attitude is generally not tolerated. There are good holidays, good pay (though now stagnated). The hours have certainly become longer since they halved the workforce. But there are rarely people shouting at you to get stuff down. Relaxed working environment. If you were married with a mortgage and modest ambitions, this would be a good place to while away the years.
";"Compared to their peers, they don't really care about being technical. Which means they don't really care about training their people or advancing their knowledge. As long as the oil and gas keeps coming out of the ground and the share price doesn't plummet its all yippee ki-yay mother..... Since the downturn in oil price, the company is just doing really boring work, which keeps the investors happy but the employees less so. The result of this means that many good and ambitious people are not motivated to stay with the company long term as there is no reward. Its all stick, no carrot.

Pros
Working on a big code base with a complicated architecture can be very challenging, especially when you need to redesign the code or add system-wide changes. You will also be working on a product with existing customers where your changes will have real-world impact.
";"Everything moves slowly in a big company due to bureaucracy and office politics. The daily schedule will include more meetings and interacting with other employees, so less writing code than in a startup.

";"They say they are 100% committed to HSE, but when it comes to stopping the job Operations will more then likely find away around the issue. I never experienced racism, but I witnessed how many of the white field techs would get promoted over Hispanic or African Americans as well as getting more hours. The culture may have changed, but when I was trying to implement the policies that management should have been implementing there was always push back from management and employees. They hire a lot of family members or friends of friends which also gives others an unfair advantage when it comes to promotions and disciplinary actions. Management definitely has their favorite employees and it shows. Schlumberger forces employees to do 52 stop cards annually which makes the stop cards (RIR) ineffective. I’d rather have quality reports than quantity. Oh and the bonuses are a joke unless you are upper management. It’s like working for a sinking ship when oil prices are down. It truly was unpleasant when you never know which day can be your last. If it’s not the “it’s Schlumberger making us do it” excuse it’s the “well we have to keep you at 40 hours to save jobs.” or “we don’t have money to fix this issue.”

Being a part of a service company in a struggling industry is tough, cuts are usually harsh and deep, but it is something you have to accept. As for the company itself, biggest con is the same with most large companies. The corporate mentality/approach to everything can be taxing, but again, you have to accept it with any large employer.

";"Sometimes the change is constant and unstopping and it seems that SLB is changing for change's sake.

This leads to a lot of people placed in open positions that they do not want but accept it because they feel they are given no other option to move forward, and people that have skill sets beyond their current role have no opportunity to present themselves and interview for something they would prefer or be better suited for as often times direct management has no knowledge or interest in understanding their subordinates motivations or talents and do not have contacts outside of their departments.

I think that those who you work with make or break the job, and while I enjoyed working with my manager and coworkers, I know of others who went through hell. If you are a woman then you should prepare yourself for sexual harassment. I know of a few women who not only faced uncomfortable situations on the rig (which sadly should be expected if you ever work in the field) but also during schlumberger training from both their peers and instructors. My manager was a woman, so I don't believe that there is anything holding back women from being successful just be prepared for a possible uncomfortable environment.

Aug 8, 2020 - Mechanical Engineer in Sugar Land, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
- Dynamic work environment - Dedicated, hardworking coworkers - Lots of training, friendly environment, they want you to learn and be safe above all else - Salary was very good, higher Bottom line: I loved my coworkers and loved the work I did, and that, to me, exceeded the cons of redundant paperwork and excessive meetings. Due to the ease of layoffs, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this job unless you are young and wouldn't be severely impeded by a layoff (as opposed to a parent, or someone looking for more stability, someone mid-career, etc).
Cons
- Too many meetings could have been emails - A lot of redundancy in internal paperwork - Depending on your position and seniority, a lot of people take their work home with them (answering emails off hours, etc). It's not necessary to do so, but many people do. This is more true for manufacturing engineers. - Very quick to lay off BUT they do provide a severance package I would describe as fair to good.

The dynamic environment under high volume and tight deadlines increases your adaptability skills set as well as time management and presentation skills. Be mindful that this will change depending on the location, department and team you work on.
";"The constant and multiple changes to be implemented at the same time give a sense of unpreparedness / unpremeditated / improvisation, specially when no proper training is provided or when after several working hours of implementation the project is left aside to work on another one. High employee rotation. The lack of a meaningful Performance Management Evaluation considered by HR as well makes Networking KEY. Minimal HR impact.

170;Valero;2015-06-03;SAP Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Good Company to work in San Antonio;"In San Antonio, one of the better employers in terms of salaries and benefits (certainly not the best in my opinion). Health and fitness is part of Valero culture. It's implicitly understood that all the employees will be out for a workout during lunch hours. Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind. It offers great work life balance. It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well. Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.
";"Valero is a conservative company. They offer very less vacation time. Work hours flexibility is less. Work-from-home option is not available. The pay (salary and benefits) may not seem attractive if compared to an IT organization. There can be a bit of micro-management.

172;Valero;2016-02-01;Benefits Analyst;Current Employee;The Best Company in the US;"Best place to work because: you have the opportunity to help others, the community you work in, your co-workers treat you with respect, the benefits are very competitive since they help you pay for your benefits, Valero cares about your well-being since they have fitness center, clinic @ head quarters and they provide a Gym subsidy for those not working at head quarters, they also provide a subsidy for day care, they also help you understand how fortunate we all are by being able to donate to many charities, and NO they don't force you to donate!, you decide for yourself how much to contribute, great pension plan, 401k matching, I can keep going on and on how great Valero is! Lastly, you get yo meet the CEO once you are hired, I mean where do you can the chance to meet the CEO, nowhere.. They also provide many charity events for our veterans, children, and many other social events that benefit the community.
";"It's hard to think about anything negative since they truly provide a great work environment.

173;Valero;2012-11-17;Supervisor;Current Employee, more than 10 years;A great culture of working hard, paying well, and giving back to the community.;"Valero provides an excellent working environment for employees, complete with on-site childcare, doctor, cafeteria, and a fitness center with tennis and basketball courts, and running trails. The company offers a leading employee compensation plan that includes excellent medical coverage options, along with a pension and 401k, among other things.
";"I know there are disgruntled employees who work here, but I struggle to understand it. It is not the place it was in 2005 when the stock price was soaring and splitting, but this is still a top of the line place to work. The best I can do to complain is to say that the upward mobility takes time. Even then, part of the reason for that is due to the fact that most employees choose not to leave, and this inhibits other people from potential promotions, transfers, etc.

";"Being micromanaged by all employees in various departments including your own, not a diverse workforce, not being acknowledged for your ideas as they get stolen, most of the ethanol plants are not near major cities, not acknowledged for working in several fields aside from your main duties, higher than normal employee turnover, a sense of entitlement in some of the key workers in all departments, some employees get ""pigeon-holed"" into an area or expertise, salary/pay is in the lower end of the industry, office/plant/division politics, employment termination can be based on lies, does not have a formal training program for the industry (ethanol production) like the refining division has.

179;Valero;2013-03-16;Retail Systems Support Level I;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Pretty great college job for a student.;"Great employee benefits. Wonderful bonuses at the start of every year (for corporate employees). Many gatherings/office parties/perks to working. Well paying! A lot of great minds are at Valero. Located in a really accessible part of town. Very good employee cafe at great prices. Upper management is usually easy to speak with.
";"The office has this high-school like clique system. Office is stuck with a 'classic' business attitude and can feel a little boring/draining, like every day is the same work over and over. Company E-Mails workers with proclamations to vote 'yes' or 'no' on. Expect a lot of time commitment out of their student workers. The office does not have many part-time workers, so they are not very understanding for those who are still growing their education. Does not promote creative growth of their employees. Office coffee is horrid. (I know this shouldn't be in the cons list, but if you try it - you'll understand).

Good centralized training at corporate. High exposure potential to upper management/corporate.
";"Not open to relocation to other refineries, high expectation on time at work (50hrs/week as a regular), no overtime on turnarounds (many oil companies offer this), no 9/80s, no flexibility in work schedule. Only hires engineers straight from college, and with the amount of experienced engineers either moving into other roles or leaving the company this is creating a very very young engineering group. This makes it hard to learn as a new engineer and hurts the reputation of the engineering group in the eyes of the rest of the refinery.

I put above there are schedule choices, but depending on your performance you may not get a schedule that works for you when there are new shift bids. Different departments have conflicting information, but it's your fault if you get something wrong because of it. Sales shouldn't be required. Period, but if you don't make them, you get in trouble. Training is a mess right now since they implemented new systems. Some things were over trained, others not nearly enough. Depending on your Supervisor and team will determine if you do well. They care way too much about call times, yet expect you to throw in sales and other information, plus the new system that takes way too long to navigate.

Call center environment that is stuck in time from about 20 years ago. Extremely micromanaged environment. In the interview, they ask if you have a cell phone. What they don't tell you is that they are routing all the calls through your cell phone while you are working from home and have your cell connected on a call the entire day. Then they tell you that you can't use your phone at all or they will know it and you will be disciplined for it. They had a trainer and 3 supervisors watching 15 people do computer training modules on camera while people are talking. They dont trust people enough to do a computer training module and test without watching you on camera. They care more about tracking you than you actually retaining the training content. The training is rushed and large amounts of documents are referenced that you are expected to know, but not given time to read them. You are put on the phones after one week of training and then ""coached"" on the things you are doing wrong.

Pros
Good environment. Opportunity to advance Pay is on par with utility industry
Cons
Work load is often very heavy The latest Reorg cut too many positions from engineering Directives from upper management can often be conflicting and not realistic
"
15;Duke;2021-09-28;Work Management Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Only use it for experience, then move on;"This job was hybrid, so I was mostly remote with 1-2 days in the office, with every other Friday off
";"Management is pretty bad, they blame you for mistakes that you didn't do or can't control. I was told to stay late or come in on my Friday off to help the team in other areas because they're behind. The pay is not the best when compared to my area. You have to work all storms, sometimes 16+ hour shifts and be back in the next morning at 7:30 am
"
16;Duke;2021-09-12;Anonymous;Current Employee;Great Company;"Duke Energy is a great company to work for. Thoughtful focus on diversity and inclusion and ensuring all employees are welcome. They also have a keep desire to ensure women & people of color are promoted and given ample opportunities.
";"Still working to ensure our teams represent the communities we serve but there is a conscious effort towards this already.

20;Duke;2021-06-15;Lead IT Business Analyst;Current Employee;Overall good company - salary for long-time employees not so great;"Overall stability and culture of the company is good. Leadership does attempt to do the right thing most of the time and values employees.
";"HR and process for promotions/salary increases is pure hell. Anytime you get a ""promotion"" or a salary increase for being a highest contributor it does not reflect the work or the person getting the promotion or increase. Does not provide a lot of drive to want to do better when you do not feel like your work is compensated fairly. So much red tape for management to provide increases and promotions and then when you do (if you are already at the company) it is dis-heartening especially when you can come right off the street and make the middle or even more of where your salary should be but someone who just got a promotion to that same pay class only gets 2-3% and is barely over the minimum for the job.

";"Training is about a month and will not prepare you for pretty much 80% of what your actual job entails. Rules and quality are constantly changing. Floor support always has a different answer and it’s your fault if you get the wrong one. Oh yeah and the system is constantly crashing and that will sometimes be your fault too. Also when I applied for this job no one told me I had to make sales each month or be at risk of termination. That wasn’t in the job description. Yet here I am. It feels like this the company cares more about metrics than the customers or employees

39;Duke;2021-07-15;Customer Care Representative;Current Employee, more than 1 year;It's Fine, but soul-sucking;"Reasonable work hours (40-hour/week with OT), remote jobs available, easy to get time off. At least right now, there's time in between calls so you're not slammed with back-to-back calls with no room to breathe. Don't know if that'll be true in the future or not.
";"It's a call center job, so some people like it, some don't. Basically a sales position masquerading as customer service. Floor support and training is a joke. Nothing they teach you beyond uber-basics is going to prepare you for the real-deal. Floor support rarely assists the reps if they have questions or technical issues and usually they're rude and dismissive. While I like my supervisor, I've heard bad things about other supervisors, so that'll be hit or miss.

Adherence for call times is unrealistic. You're basically back to back on every call and if you try to take a break or be detailed with calls, its seen as a negative. They rate your performance on how quickly you can get customers on and off the phone, but tout that they want the best customer service. You can't have both. If you're the kind of person that can let stuff roll off your shoulders and you can handle the pressure, then this could be a good place for you to grow.

Unique job to have and they give you everything you need to do the job including a company vehicle and corporate card. Looks good on a resume. Pays well and weekly. Short term, this is a steady gig to pay the bills.
";"Grey area rules that leadership can break if they want to and lack of communication from leadership. It feels like we are never told the whole truth, even worse, it feels like you’re getting lied to your face. Failure to deliver on three major promises: growth, “plenty of” OT (got none and never will), and a 6 month title change/pay bump. It hasn’t even been a year and people are quitting for something else. The department is growing large too quickly. A byproduct of this growth is that it has veered from a family model feeling to a corporate one. Guys feel like drones and morale is low.

";"-Lack of transparency about salary ranges makes it difficult to ensure that gender parity is achieved. -Parental leave should be extended to twelve weeks for fathers. Equity in this area is important.

";"To be honest, though, Duke was the definition of a sweatshop. We had a new baby at the time I worked there and I was honestly awake working more than my wife was feeding the baby. As a DBA, when on-call, you would get at least 3 or 4 calls in the middle of the night. Sometime, you would get no sleep at all. Then, Duke would require you to be in the office for your ""regular"" 8 hours. I put that in quotes, because what they really expected was more like 9 or 10, regardless if you had all of your work done.

Been here over a year and only asked to work on a Sat once for a big, rare upgrade, never asked to stay late and encouraged to take vacation (3 weeks) as well as take company-paid training. 401K match is 4% then up to 6% matching, which has been great. Can work remotely if I'm sick or have an appointment at home which is nice. Speaking up, collaboration, helping others is highly encouraged.
";"A few teams could follow the Agile approach to their benefit a bit more closely.

309;Duke;2020-10-01;Engineering Technologist;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Ready to be nothing more than a glorified retail worker? This place is for you!;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.
";"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.

If you end up identifying longstanding problems(like they tell you they want you to do) it becomes your problem to solve them. It can be quite frustrating and overwhelming. Coworkers are thickheaded and not receptive to innovative ideas and can be extremely cynical and negative - it is contagious. There is a reason why this facility has struggled for years to even simply make par with regulating organizations - the culture of its employees is terrible! More on that: personnel are very clichy. If you don't agree with them on issues be prepared for your job to be impossible. There is a subliminal level of harassment to this. In all honesty I'd have left within a couple on months of the job initially; however, per the relocation agreement, I'd owe every cent of a hefty sum back if I left within two years of my hire date. There are still quite a few new hires that have left within a couple months of being hired and paid back the money anyway just to get out. I am counting down to my two year mark.

456;Duke;2015-12-09;IT Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;If you work in IT, not a great company to work for;"Very flexible work schedule and teleworking policy. Work/life balance is generally quite easy to maintain.
";"Individual contributors are buried under excessive layers of incompetent management that are all desperate to prove how useful they are. Turnover rate for top talent is pretty high, and what's left bubbles up into management, mostly based on seniority, not skill. Any attempt at innovation or original thought is quickly squashed by a pervasive ""this is the way we've always done it"" monoculture. Very slow to adapt. Pay for IT jobs is way below market average. Benefits are not what they used to be, so it's become even less competitive than it was in years past, and that's not saying much. Management has basically been a game of musical chairs for years now. Re-orgs several times a year means that your manager is pretty much guaranteed to not have a clue about what you specialize in, but that doesn't stop most of them from from micromanaging you and telling you how you should do your job.

460;Duke;2008-12-28;Station Equipment Expert;Current Employee;Duke Energy is a great place to work.;"Duke has great employees at all levels in the power plants. The union and non union employees work together to get the job done. Duke has been great to work for and has helped me move into better jobs over the years. They paid for my college and gave me the opportunities I needed to make a great career. I started in the union and worked my way into a management position. The aging workforce at Duke will give me and others many more opportunities to work into other interesting jobs over the next few years. The benefits are great too. We enjoy good medical, dental and eye care benefits and a great vacation policy.
";"Duke has yet to complete the total combination of the latest merger with Cinergy. There are a lot of problems that are handled differently between the Carolina plants and the Midwest plants. The cultures are so different it will be hard to ever make the entire company look the same.
"
461;Duke;2016-03-31;Lead;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Headed in the wrong direction;"Duke is a laid back environment. Most of the company leaves by noon on Fridays and everyone works relaxed hours. Benefits are good, aside from the health insurance.
";"Since the merger with Progress there has been nothing but trouble. Progress was in financial ruins due to management running that company into the ground. Unfortunately much of that management has been brought into Duke. There are numerous managers (upper level) that do not have degrees nor the competence and training to do their job. The Progress side is like a fraternity that sticks together and promotes each other within. It is very disheartening. They are quickly running out the talent and bringing this once fine company down. I have seen employees use their company cards for lunch every day of the week as well as company vehicles given to employees that have no need. Instead of making employees move to Charlotte they allow a large number of individuals to travel almost weekly on the company’s dime to Charlotte headquarter. The fleecing is alarming. I am concerned not only as an employee but as a customer of Duke as well. This company is in serious need of a management over hall.
"
462;Duke;2016-02-13;Customer Service Representative;Former Employee, more than 1 year;The bad outweighs the good;"Unlimited overtime and sales commission. This company would pay $10 per person you setup on load control for resident's heating and cooling systems. Also you could get 80 hours of PTO and 80 hours of sick time upfront. They would also contribute $500 a year to your healthcare spending card.
";"The managers at the call center on Rush St in Raleigh are highly unprofessional and immature. So much gossip and hypocrisy there it was very much like high school. I heard a team lead hang up on several customers. Also, the call volume is extremely high. I'm talking 80-200 calls in queue all day long. Keep in mind this is the largest utility company in the nation. My average phone call was 5 minutes and I would take 100+ calls a day all while adhering to rules to abide by while on the call. Calls are scored. Only accept this job if you absolutely have to. If you like your sanity steer clear. The $$ may be appealing but it's not worth it at all.
"
463;Duke;2015-11-06;Anonymous;Former Employee;Engineer;"Large Company that expands across many disciplines. I find that Duke as a whole is a really good company. Great benefits, flex time, and in my former department Fridays we had off (4-10 schedule).
";"In my division, I found that it was hard to try a different position once you were in your current role. You become the expert and no one really wants to allow you to expand your knowledge on other things. I worked in the Nuclear Division and making moves outside of the Nuclear world within the company proved to be hard at times. So in the nuclear department career development wasn't so expansive unless you were gearing up to be a manage within that particular organization. Again, Duke is huge so the opportunities are there and expand far beyond the nuclear world so it would have been nice to be able to explore some of those options.

But basically you’ll be paying rent but technically not live there because you’ll live at Duke Energy: The CEO got a nice raise but our office in Raleigh is run down , vending machines always taking our money, old computers, computer systems always down, website always down, phone payment system always down which causes high call volume..

";"Top management is not committed to employees. Too much red tape to get through to get the job done quickly, efficiently and correctly. Too many layers of management cause important communications to drop into the black hole of , ""I never got the memo."" Benefits cut, pensions cut. Horrible HR (outsourced). Pay is stable but you are expected to work many more hours for the same pay. It's normal for salaried folks (who are not part of management) to work 50 + hours a week with no additional compensation. Employees have so much on their shoulders, and are under so much pressure that I expect many more will suddenly leave or retire. No transparency with changes that affect employee or retiree benefits.

The benefits are average. Since I have been here so long, I get 6 weeks vacation. That's a great benefit...if I actually get to use it.
";"Compared to other utilities, Duke is well known to be one of the lowest paying utility companies, especially in Nuclear. Compared to other companies, Duke's health care costs are high. Management, at least Nuclear, is not supportive or even respect employees. They often say one thing and do another. They have personally lied to me several times. They point fingers and blame employees but when asked for details they cannot provide facts to support blaming individuals. Expectations for themselves is lower than what they expect of individual workers. Duke expects you to wear a beeper 24/7 and be available for call out and come to work within 75 minutes but there is no compensation for this. They do not respect work/life balance. More and more they expect doing more work with fewer people. They expect workers to just absorb work when people leave.

I really left due to my AWFUL manager who was put in his position for one reason and one reason only -- his race, a card he played to get ahead.

";"Promotions are generally driven by politics versus performance. Although your performance is measured on a yearly basis, your ability to move up the ladder will require strong networking skills. To accept a good career opportunity, you will have to accept a lower salary to begin. The rapid growth can be a negative as you try to understand the company vision, goals, and culture. The company did not settle into its 1st merger before going into a 2nd recent merger which brought in more new visions, ideas, and new management. Trying to navigate through the continual change can be challenging and stressful.

This means a few things to me, more natural gas power plants and more renewables, but also lots of cost cutting efforts. I feel that Duke Energy is taking the right steps when considering the customers, employees, and public.
";"The change management leaves something to desire. There are a lot of moving parts and some changes result in breaking existing processes.

";"Limitations on moving up within the company, especially in Renewables. Feels like a ""good ol' boys club"". Not a diverse group. Upper Management doesn't understand day to day operations or life in rural areas. Area Managers are not held accountable. If a site manager can talk the talk, nobody will actually look into whether or not that manager is doing their job, following policy or procedures nor if they are holding their staff accountable. This position is very repetitive, and not many extra projects, challenging projects. To move up from this position is difficult because of lack positions within the group that relate to the skill set and background you already have as an SRC.

Managers tend to be promoted from withing, which can be a blessing or a curse.
";"Some 'dead wood' that has been there a long time and no real performance management done to weed them out. Managers not willing to deal with it.

";"As with any large organization, bureacracy and mediocre employees will significantly impede progress. Duke does not really reward performance financially.

Pros
Very interesting and diverse work. The management is generally very strong and employee oriented. There is potential for growth but you need to develop your own networking system. If you are a recent college grad they have implemented programs that help you learn about the diverse areas of the company. They offer a rotation program in the IT department so you can experience many different facets of IT prior to deciding where you will settle.
Cons
Due to some of the downsizing in recent years, many folks have more work than they can possibly manage. Sometimes it takes a little time to get things processed and completed.

";"One of their biggest pros creates one of their biggest cons. Since they always try and keep employees, you'll find people that don't belong in their roles and simply aren't capable. This is common for many of the older workers who aren't quite to retirement and just looking for a few more years work. It should eventually phase out with the older portion of the workforce.

";"This company doesn't value competent employees. Underachievers are routinely promoted and picked to manage teams, with distraous results to employee performance and team morale. Management pulls on high performing employees to carry the weight with little recognition. Work/life balance is laughable, especially during severe weather.

";"If you're hired as a contractor there are very few pros. Hiring process for anything in nuclear takes a long time, 3-6 months minimum, and a lot of positions are filled by contractors so it can be difficult to get a direct hire position especially for entry/low level positions.

Advice to Management
Don't buy into the corporate values mumbo jumbo, managers don't lead by example. If you face harassment, don't bother to complain to HR, because HR will only protect the managers, not you. Complaining will only lead to retaliation, even though HR tells you it is not allowed, don't believe it. Essentially, your career will be gone.

85;Shell;2021-08-20;Project Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Mixed Review - Experience will vary;"Very high pay compared to other engineering jobs. Starting salary was 50% higher out of college than average starting salary for someone with an engineering degree. Bonus is good (when we get one). Great relocation benefits when the company asks you to move. Work-life balance can be good depending on your role.
";"Strange company culture. The company expects employees to work for them forever. Company expects 100% loyalty, but doesn't offer it in return. Talking about anything outside the company is taboo, whether it is an idea that originated from outside the company, part-time continuing education at a university, or future career plans. Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take. Company moved IT and HR to an offshore call center. Anytime you need to talk to someone from HR or IT you need to call a 1800 number and get put on hold for hours and then receive poor customer service. The company's back office financial department is a mess. Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another. Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know. Company expects you to relocate with your family every few years. I've seen this destroy families. Very burocratic company, everything is driven by process, but it seems like nobody knows the process, and it seems like there are multiple processes for the same thing.
Advice to Management
None, I think the company is so big that things are not able to be changed.

86;Shell;2021-08-21;Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;OK, but company outlook is grim and growth opportunities are limited;"- Pay is well and beats competitors in similar industry.
- Before Convent personnel joined, culture was friendly.
- 9/80 flex schedule.
";"- Culture is starting to become harsh and toxic. Convent culture is polluting the leadership team.
- Growth opportunities are limited. Once upon a time there were plenty of growth opportunities across the Shell businesses. Now its non-existent. Manufacturing employees are seen as black sheep of Shell business.
- Leadership does not practice what is preached. 
- Company politics involved with personnel moves and promotions.
- Terrible reliability and operational performance that metrics are hiding.
- Over worked Engineers nights and weekends for areas they do not support.
- No focus on career path. Development plan is a paper work exercise for managers.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees. Shell People Survey results are speaking the truth. Correct the issues before employees continue to leave.

91;Shell;2021-08-17;Material Planner;Former Employee, more than 1 year;WARNING....Worst Work/life balance;"Worked at Shell in Woodcreek in Houston, TX. The only thing that was worth about working for Shell oil sector was the pay. Eventhough I never received a bonus.
";"No bonus because they are subjective based on how the company performs. 

The worst work/life balance I had ever experience. They ""give"" you every other Friday off, however, you better be online working or else you will fall behind. I would find myself working sometimes until midnight during the week to keep up with work. At times, I would work on the weekends to stay up to date and would notice my coworkers and cross-functional teams would be doing the same as they would be ""online"" via skype. Shell used skype (like many use Zoom) for you to show your online status (offline, away, in a meeting, etc.). Managers would use your online status to gauge how ""good"" of an employee you were. I was warned/counseled by my upper management because they noticed my online status had been ""away"" 3 times in a day for 20 mins each time and to them that was unacceptable. Diversity and Inclusion is not a top priority. If your last name did not start with ""Van something"" or you are not Dutch, forget about climbing the corporate ladder there. Dealt with 5 reorganizations in two years, which means it is very unstable and many people kept getting laid off.
Advice to Management
Stop walking around the floors like you are some big shot and humble yourselves.

";"Downstream is worse than upstream. These comments are related to downstream at Shell. Sr leaders do no stay in their roles long enough. Result….they don’t know what they are doing. They only manage for the qtr, week, day…not for long term profitability or viability. Everyone there is just looking to keep their head down so they don’t fired. They say you are free to speak your mind….you are not. You can say only what they want to hear…but really challenge and you will be gone at the next re-0rg. They Re-org about every 2-3 years.

Keep Sr leaders in their role for 6+ year at a min. 
Set up businesses so 2-3 level of management can run their whole show without a ton of other approvals needed….and hold them accountable for results.

196;Shell;2021-05-31;Senior IT Manager;Former Employee, more than 10 years;IT Innovation at Retaliation;"Company was extremely committed to ethics, the environment, innovation and betterment of it's people and community most of the time I worked there. Something has changed.
";"I was informed, during a two year extreme harassment and ""online shame"" campaign, formal retaliation has been taking place by the IT department through vendors and strategic recruiters/IT contingent workforce suppliers. The attackers claimed I had reported a boss for ""harassment"" (implying sexual harassment). I had made a report about a boss changing names on important documents. It handled well by the company at the time.

 I wound up leaving the company a year later, definitely NOT because I was pushed out, but because it was time to stretch after 15 years. What I found out really happened was systematic blacklisting at new jobs by IT leaders on a reactive and false premise that I had made a harassment claim to the company. I recall the benevolent warning from a contractor (military background) working with security risk teams about Shell using the vendors and third party partners to do the blacklisting. This ultimately became true, yet it also indicates the IT security and risk organizations are well aware of what they are doing by using category /suppliers this way.

One recruiter tried to negotiate my salary down WELL below market value, while two organizations were just odd I had worked with and I wondered why the tone had changed suddenly to very hostile.
Advice to Management
Consider the chilling effect of retaliation which can result in individuals not making the right reports about ethics and safety issues. Further training for IT management on anti-retaliation policy. In depth review of the practices of the IT strategic recruiters, information security information sharing consortiums, and suppliers /consulting firms regarding both their privacy (I was digitally stalked) and anti-retaliation practices. Ratings were five star, yet now I have learned a lot after a severe incident and deliberately (possibly funded) harassment campaign.

264;Shell;2021-03-13;Upstream Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Politics and constant reorgs...;"* Pay

* Possibility of pension

* Possibility of cancer treatment for you and family

* Some people your work with

*Supports diversity

*Preaches safety

Only recommend this place if your looking for a higher salary (overall benefits actually suck)
";"Something along the lines of 'Nimble as a mid-major, capable as a Super Major'.... was a slogan that was paraded around the office, this couldn't be further from truth. I laughed every time I heard it or saw it written down.

* Your constantly working in fear b/c of reorganizations/layoffs. I was with Shell for two years and survived three reorganizations... let that sink in, three reorganizations within two years... 

* US leadership is inept; Shell is EXTREMELY top heavy and they don't care about the individual contributor. To survive and move up in the organization its all about politics. New roles are created for leadership when their position is eliminated/reorg'ed.

* Little to no diversity in leadership

* Terrible work-life balance, working through lunch and after hours was a norm, very lean teams

* Shell does a poor job leveraging technology and relies heavily on its people, burn out was constant; spreadsheets without analytics or dashboards. Things could easily be automated but leadership has no interest in it b/c of the work/testing/downtime involved, business as usual attitude. 

* Majority of IT is outsourced to consultants in India where turnover is rampant... Good luck getting an IT project/initiative off the ground without delays or having something somewhere else break.

* New initiatives are constantly being rolled out only to be ignored or replaced a few months later.

* They are slowly ""migrating""/outsourcing jobs out of the US. Majority of IT and Accounting is already outsourced to Asia. Rumors were HR is on the chopping block next

* Extremely inefficient process flows, leadership has little to no interest in addressing it

* Benefits are actually lousy: 3% 401k match; a windowed RDS share purchase plan; hardly any local, regional, or national offers; health insurance is EXPENSIVE; etc.

* Its great that you preach safety, but your record speaks otherwise

Working as an IT advisor in the manufacturing space provides lots of exposure to IT and business processes which has served as an excellent learning opportunity. Hours are usually stable with some extra work expected around major maintenance events and during large projects.
";"Collaboration with overseas colleagues can be challenging especially with so many support roles outsourced to India. 5AM is their evening so finding overlapping working hours is nearly impossible.
Bonuses are tied to the oil price and profitability of the company. While I understand that, some of my highest performing years have been years when bonuses have been cut to 0%.
While technical knowledge is valued, my role as an advisor doesn't allow me to focus much on individual technologies. I feel a mile wide and an inch deep on many technical topics because of this.
Shell constantly talks about upskilling and spending work time on training. However I have found that they rarely actually make time for anything but basic training.

Strive to change from a company that thinks it knows it all... to one that tries to continually learn and grow and adapt. The arrogance of the former is stifling and unattractive culturally, to gen-ex's, millennials and younger generation employees. Also, walk the talk in upper management when it comes to diversity.

";"Depending on your skill set, you can be pigeon holed quickly (and it could take you years to figure it out). Management and HR literally estimate your maximum potential at the company. I lovingly referred to it as my glass ceiling. There are periods when they hire management from other companies, which disincentivized people in management to stay. (Look at the bios of top management in the US to see if they left Shell and came back.) Maybe this has changed since I have left, but it’s something to keep in mind for career planning.

Wonderful pay and benefits; they are targeted at the 75th percentile. The company is extremely concerned about your health & safety and work-life balance. The full package here is practically unbeatable.
";"Most of the IT staff is in India. If you're in the US, 5:00 and 6:00 AM meetings are not unusual (but not really common). If you're in India, expect to be on calls after 7 with US staff. You may not be on the same continent with the rest of your team or your lead or your manager.

It's still a consensus-based culture, and I'd like to see more managers able to make the tough decision and move forward, even if not everyone agrees. It still feels like it takes too long for anything to happen.

Weekly 1-on-1s with your supervisor are not part of the culture.
Advice to Management
Require everyone's annual performance goals to be measurable and have a time component. All of the GPAs I saw (in IT) up the line had at least a couple vaguely defined goals that were written so that there was no way to be accountable for not achieving the goal.

Jan 23, 2021 - Senior Mechanical Engineer in Houston, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Very good health insurance, 401k, pension, bonus (performance bonus and turnaround bonus).
Cons
Work life balance is non existent at a refinery/chemical plant.
Been with Shell for 7 years and went thru 3 reorg/layoffs already. Seems like the industry growth isn’t just slowing, it’s contracting.
Management decision is very slow. They seem to have lofty goals but doesn’t really accomplish them. More and more I feel like management is trying to push more and more site wide initiatives onto individual contributors which is frustrating because individual contributors don’t have the same pull as a manager or senior manager.
Constantly in meetings that feel like nothing is accomplished and no value is added.
Advice to Management
Keep large initiatives at management level. Have more vision than just cost cutting and “becoming more lean” because it clearly isn’t making the impact that it should. Try looking at more options to make more money rather than putting all of your focus on spending less.

2;EnterpriseProducts;2021-08-31;Senior Project Manager;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Pretty Good Place to Work;"Most people are knowledgeable and easy to get along with. 6% 401K salary match and another 4% on top of that for a total 10% match. Decent salaries and bonuses. Stock discount program. Free gym for downtown employees. Not too much bureaucracy compared to other places I've worked.
";"Limited upward mobility, and sometimes operations personnel are difficult to deal with. Management is overly conservative with things like working from home/and remote (they explicitly said they will not be doing this).
"
3;EnterpriseProducts;2021-09-29;Accountant;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Great benefits but be prepared for a lot of work!;"Pay is good and benefits are second to none. Health insurance costs less with twice the coverage of my previous employer. Heavily subsidized parking or free bus passes for commuters.
";"Old school O&G mindset in management. Expect long hours and no flex time or work from home opportunities here. Also, PTO is mediocre at best.

Good pay is the only reason to be here. Other departments at this company may have acceptable working conditions but the EHST Department has serious issues both in the field and corporate offices.
";"Widespread compliance issues and failing infrastructure that are severe enough to undermine the company's long term sustainability and stock prices. Understaffed and overworked. Zero flexibility (no flex time, no comp time, no work from home, no alternative schedule). If you are sick and have to take leave they still expect you to work at home while you are gone. Since they don't allow working from home, you will be expected to take PTO and work from home while sick. Hard work is rewarded with more work, not advancement. No support for employees with covid, or for employees with family members with covid.

19;EnterpriseProducts;2021-08-25;Measurement Automation Technician;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Deceiving and dangerous management;"Lots of different challenges, out of town projects and assignments.
";"Everything else. Spend over a week out of town jumping thru hoops to make a project work out because a project manager dropped the ball? Yep, you'll be told to do that. Leave town often to finalize, perform electrical inspections, program RTUS, coordinate and lead contractors, then finally perform point to point checkouts and report daily? Yep you'll be told to do that. Even tho an electrical inspector is sleeping in his damn truck, you'll need to do that because none cares. Inspect all pneumatic tubing, reverse engineer faulty designs, set up control valves, both gas and liquid with NO TRAINING!!! It had better work, or it's your but t. Do multiple tasks with liability on you, with little to no support from ""management"" and you'll probably fail. Then you will be fired. They are required to provide you with ppe. After two years, never received my electrical gloves. Got tired of asking. At first, they cost too much money. Then they forgot. This department is a disaster you will REGRET. they have zero leadership and are 100% looking out for thier golden ladder. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!. Can't believe I left a decent job at p 66 for this sham. I wanna go back to my I&E job. Enterprise is all about the$$$$$$$$$$$ to those up top. Everyone else is disposable. No bonuses for anyone other than the salaried, they brag about record quarterly earnings, you might get a 2.5% ""cost of living adjustment"" if you're lucky. There is no end of year review process, and the departments can do that if they want, however they want, or not at all. You're kept in the dark on most everything, and really are not a part of a workgroup. Required training (CPR, fire extinguisher, etc...) needs to be scheduled by you, and kept up with by you, and if they need you out of town you'll need to reschedule. This often leads to being out of compliance on these, and.... its ON YOU! A culture of fear is how they run the company, every policy has the term ""up to and including termination"" for a reason. I never had one single infraction and was fired out of nowhere. Just don't work here

";"Cronyism and nepotism are rampant. The leadership is weak and stingy. There are NO policies that would protect employees from unscrupulous management. No trust in nor regard for employees that I could see and I was there for several years. The starting pay is high for the area but below their competitors so the best talent goes elsewhere. Raises are small for the average employee so if you accept a position here I would recommend negotiating the highest starting wage possible, get a few years of experience in the industry, and get out. Several departments have this kind of revolving door with a 1-2 year turnaround. Money seems to be the only thing management cares about, and they make lots of it, but it does NOT trickle very far down from the top.

";"Since July, it’s 100% back in the office with zero allowance for work from home. See other reviews about old school culture, that’s coming back in the form of the company actively opposing any accommodation for work from home, even if you have kids in virtual schooling. Masks are required at all times in the office (good) but other than that they’re pretending it’s business as usual. Management stresses “personal responsibility” and not coming to work if sick at all, but it costs vacation time if you call in sick. The incentives and the message don’t line up.

Competitive benefits package for the oil and gas industry; including stock options and bonus opportunities for exempt employees that prove to be strong performers. Great work hours with ½ days on Friday to maintain home life/work balance.
";"I’ve read some of the reviews and I agree with several comments. There is a lack of consistency for internal processes in some of the departments, as well as, a lack of communication. The company is trying to address these areas of improvement like many other companies. Sadly, there are many underqualified, poor performing, and underperforming employees in the company that are getting compensated for trying to “look busy” in a slow market. These employees are taking advantage of the situation. The company needs to trim the fat. The high performers even in a slow market continue to outshine these individuals; it’s easier to “see” who needs to be cut and it’s time to take care of business in our cost-savings environment.

101;EnterpriseProducts;2016-06-23;Scheduler;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Scheduler;"Let's get real. YES, Enterprise is a giant corporation. YES, sometimes the corporate office is a meat grinder. YES, sometimes management is hard on you. YES, there are communications breakdowns across groups...blah blah blah. But let's get real, what major corporation doesn't have these issues?? You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb. Cliché or not, that's what I've experienced, and there's my two cents.

104;EnterpriseProducts;2015-03-01;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Not what it used to be. Sadly.;"For the first 3 years I RAVED about working for this company. I've been in my profession for nearly 40 years and this is by far the best company I have worked for. Then Dan Duncan, the founder, died and the sharks took over. Dan started out as a truck driver and built a multi billion dollar enterprise but he never forgot what it meant to take care of the workers. I still love my job after seven years. Excellent pay and benefits. Depends on your location and department as to how well you will be treated.
";"As eluded to in the Pros section, this company has lost sight of it's employees and has a single focus on it's shareholders. Enterprise, to it's credit continues to make record earnings each quarter but it is also constantly taking away things from the employees. The company has lost a great number of its employees over just the past 4 years because it no longer appears to care for its people. This is a ""perception paranoid"" driven company. Common sense seems to have gone out the window for fear of an unfavorable perception of everything from peers to managers to the public. Depending on your department, you may or may not love this company. My department is a quagmire of paranoia and backstabbing.

105;EnterpriseProducts;2014-02-11;Pipeline Controller;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Pipeline Controller;"They pay good for your experience. Good benefits. Some good people to work for if you get the right manager and team mates. Good schedule and you get almost all of your days off. I would recommend a friend to get training to go elsewhere.
";"Prompt the wrong people, if you're not a suck a** forget it even though you have more knowledge and may be better for the job. Management lacks direction. Managers are puppets for the upper management. They PREACH safety but all management cares about is the bottom dollar and how much money is made at all cost. There's a sever lack of professionalism. No bonuses or sick time. You work under a microscope and everyone wants to place blame elsewhere. It's constant CYA. You are a robot and better not make a mistake. Large control room and have lost the TEAM atmosphere. People will step on you to get ahead and try to make you look bad to better themselves. Management lets you know you're just a pee'on and there's constant micro-management and braidment from Management. Management blows the smallest things out of proportion and lets everyone know about it. Over worked and now one cares. High turnover rate. If you want good pay and benefits you have to put up with way to much politics, but that comes with the large setting of the conrtol room. There is a clear divide among control groups. I would take less money for less headache and BS.

";"There is no clear picture about what transpires at the end of the three year program and how the transition will occur and the level of personal ""say"" in the permanent position.

Still buy their units when they go on sale. Not sure how much culture nd changed since founder Dan Duncan's death, but he kept company ethical, fair, and honest.
";"Lots of rapid acquisitions made recordkeeping and chain of title a challenge on assets. Left company for external opportunity after HR offered me 10% less for an opening than they would offer an external candidate because it would have been too large of an incremental raise for me. Yes, they literally confirmed that to me. Stupid policy, I had four years of company culture, connections and SOPs. Job hopping sends the only way to get a real raise these days. Sure worked out better for me.

111;EnterpriseProducts;2018-03-19;Anonymous;Former Employee;Bad Management Good People;"- The People - One of the best aspects of working at Enterprise was the people you interact with on a daily basis. The majority of the ""worker"" level people are smart, capable and friendly. - The Assets - Enterprise has a lot of assets that are well integrated and well run by the Operations team. This makes it much easier to do your job as a member of the team at the corporate office. - Bonuses - Once you get into the bonus pool, the LTIP and STIP are both very competitive.
";"- Management - From the VP level to Senior Management, there is a lot of incompetence and arrogance. The management team overall treats the employees of the company very poorly. They push them to work more hours and get more and more work done, but there's no appreciation for the dedication. Employees are regularly scolded or reminded that they are replaceable. - Lack of upward mobility - There is very high turnover at Enterprise, so you would think this would result in a lot of merit based promotions, but that's not the case. Promotions are regularly given based on who you are friends with rather than the work you're doing. This creates discord among the employees and puts unqualified personnel in power positions.

";"No life/work balance in my job at all. Horrendous rude and inconsiderate management, local supervisors are not knowledgeable in any area. Company management threatens and harasses employees. Management has a never-ending dump the liability on the working man mentality. Insane crazy amount of documentation designed to cover the supervisor’s rear in case anything “Bad” happens. Claim they own you 24/7 and force you to be on call 24/7 365 days a year (yes employees were told they could even be called into work if they were on vacation days!) Supervisor forced a very devoted employee to quit and then threw a celebration because Supervisor thought the Area manager would be so pleased he did so. Employees so stressed that an unusually large percentage have left on short term disability. May have to quit this job, stress is awful!

Secondly, it's also true that the company fails to take corrective action when it comes to low, under performing or poor performing employees (which is nice for the under performing employee - but not for their colleagues. It makes for a frustrating work environment. Thirdly, there are several unwritten policies regarding position titles, how/when people get promoted or can transfer positions, etc. and each business unit seems to have it's own policies. It's very ambiguous and makes it hard for the employee who desires to grow with the company to be able to set career growth goals. There is also no mentorship (unless you're an intern) or succession planning program.

";"Management/supervision will listen to your advice and suggestions then ignore you and do nothing. I mentioned safety issues many times and followed the hierarchy up. I had an unusual connection with Mr. Creel, even lunched with him downtown. Finally mentioned I had some issues, how should I deal with it. He referred me to two VP's and after much anguish I went to one of them with the issues I had tried to solve with lower levels. Inside of one month many changes were made and are ongoing. Less than six months after I exposed the poor safety culture, the West Storage facility blew up. I wish I had acted sooner. After that I began to feel much pressure and less cooperation and help from the safety department. It was obvious I was on my way out. That pressure along with them putting me in unsafe situations broke my health and they would not find work for me and I was 'eased out' on LTD. I am hoping that the culture has changed for the better but from what I read on here, it doesn't sound much improved and turnover rate is worse.

";"- No raises in 2 years for the entire business is unsustainable, along with very little acknowledgement by management that it is a problem - Leadership communication is poor. Imagine your favorite politician ducking a debate question and you have what it looks like when upper leadership answers a question in an ""all-hands"" meeting. - There are many legacy systems that can be extremely hampering to innovation and positive change. - Organizational change seems to comes in waves where we swing from one mode of operation and then back to the next every time upper management changes every 12-18 months. This erodes standard ways of doing work and causes people to fall back on informal channels to get work done (which falls apart completely when someone leaves or changes roles). - Specific issue aligning a tier 2 business that is owned by GE but operates as if its independent. Their goals seem completely divorced from the GE units they operate with leading to lost opportunities for GE as a whole.

There are islands of excellent SW Development teams and to be a part of those is really fun but those are quite segregated and the leadership might not be in the same mindset.

38;GeneralElectric;2021-08-30;Assembly Engineer;Former Employee, more than 3 years;You're on your own;"Pay is competitive. Very loose and casual work environment. Awesome learning experience to work with Union employees.
";"Job security is based solely on a seniority/buddy merit system instead of performance. Performance can burn you out and will only make your daily job easier via respect from Union mechanics who can make your job easy or impossible. It's a two sided place. Union and Salary. Both sides eat their own based on personality or likeability. It's a highschool with immature baby boomers manipulating their way to a pension. The lack of training and accountability makes it an interesting social gathering.

";"Former CEO made terrible business decisions that nearly drove the company into the ground. Working level employees constantly being told they aren’t good enough when the poor business position was due to the decisions of the CEO and upper management. Constant layoffs and threats of more layoffs really wears one down and it has been deflating to see so many good people laid off because of the former CEO’s bad decisions and politics. Layoffs used to be based on performance, the more recent ones were political (poor performers protected by labor laws in their home country versus high performers being let go because their home country did not have the same labor protections). So despite the fact that I’ve overall rated the company on the high side, I don’t think I would recommend a friend to work at GE.

";"*GE is currently heavily white male, and senior leadership and HR seem to be pursuing a ""purge"" of white males using several tactics: ....*Have established racial and gender quotas for hiring and promotions ....*Have regular Problem Solving Reports (PSR's) and Action Plans explicitly intended to reduce the proportion of white male employees in the company ....*The standard annual performance review includes a ""9-blocker"" where all employees are ranked against one another; in this 9-blocker, all employees are highlighted in a special color for extra consideration, except for white US males (females highlighted in pink, US non-white highlighted in blue, international highlighted in green) ....*Regularly promote ""Affinity Groups"" to celebrate all groups but Caucasians and males ....*Have cancelled all mid-career programs and tuition reimbursement ....*Have cancelled the pension and generally reduced benefits ....*Continue to focus resources on early career development, and hiring non-white-males to replace the ones they are scaring off ....*White males are generally not hired or promoted except as a last resort (which still happens often, simply due to the sheer number of qualified white male applicants) *This creates a fairly toxic culture, where white males feel they are viewed as ""the problem"" and non-white-males feel that they are viewed as ""diversity hires"" (an incredible disservice to all of our amazing, talented, hard-working employees) *Ironically, the company is largely led by white males at the executive level, and they wholeheartedly support the purge of other white males beneath them (presumably because it is a great PR move for them, and it keeps them safe) *The company preaches integrity and candor, but everyone knows that they are not allowed to question the company's new focus on discriminating against its own employees based on gender and skin color. *Not surprisingly, GE currently has a problem with attrition (including with ""diverse"" employees), as many subject matter experts flee the company

It was the easiest job I've ever had. The people were nice, we had permissive leave so I took roughly 5 weeks vacation per year and never heard any complaints from the management. It was super corporate, but I attribute that as the reason why they could pamper us so well.
";"They closed the office as a whole and laid off the 100 or so employees. This was a result of the long term effects of Covid-19. That said, GE does have a very real philosophy of looking at the numbers and cutting costs in any way possible, even if it's heartless and short sighted. I realize this is standard for any company this large, but as a result of it, any long term employee there is well aware that they need to shift their position regularly to match whatever is the most profitable side of the business at the time. The only thing you can count on at GE is CHANGE.

I am never bored with my own ability to be constantly learning while working through my projects. There is opportunity to succeed and fail by your own merit and on your terms. The company is going through a restructuring in both physical and mental culture shift. It is slow but moving in the right direction even in some of the oldest shops.
";"Times are tough - there is no sugarcoating it. People are burned out and having to take on roles that previously were held by multiple people. There was a lot of fat to trim in the company but it unfortunately bleeds down to the manufacturing floor primarily. There are not enough millennials who want to come in and work in an older company and facility and that is what GE needs more of to maintain longevity.

";"GE has an elitist culture. It's part of the reason for their current turmoil. They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs. It's nerve-wracking to work there, never knowing which department they will completely dissolve next.

In most offices (if not all), have a relaxed dress code. Not having to dress in business casual is a bigger deal than you may think. It would be hard for me to work with a company that doesn't have a relaxed dress code now. 3. Great work flexibility
";"1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.

";"Utilizes a team environment but management makes decisions. Always behind on work due to poor planning. Management changes often resulting in the ""rebuilding of the wheel"" constantly. Utilizes too many interns and 'fresh out of college' hires who are given leadership roles over the teams with disastrous effects. Absolutely worst employee/employee work environment- Not a pleasant place to work.

The IT Org is in a constant state flux, no job security. They do not provided any development opportunities, no training nothing that cost money. They also don't care about their employees, they just laid-off several hundred or even thousand workers in the middle of a pandemic without even batting an eye... I wonder if they took money for the PPA from the goverment? The point stay away from this place, it is a career killer.

";"No work balance, global teams force required work odd hours, understaffed. US engineers have to cover for lack of knowledge due to constant turn over at global places since GE is not competitive globally. Global places are covered by labor laws by limited hours and guarantied vacation that has to be compensated but US engineers with long unpaid hours as result US salary people also do not take adequate vacation. Very high stress as ""beating continues until moral improves"". Company constantly chipping away benefits. Limited - not competitive 401k investment choices. Matching company contribution is payed at the end of the year another chip of benefits so if somebody leave before end of the year they do not have to pay it. Low chance of promotion in USA as GE moves more and more engineering to global places.

";"GE needs to get back to the basics of focusing on great products, great customer service and long term growth (and turnaround) strategy as opposed to quarterly short-term metrics that hurt the long term strategy.

The program is excellent, they provide every thing from monthly salary ( more than $2000) which increase by 15% when you finish half your major. They also take care of the tuition and they provide book allowance each semester that is $ 1000. The pay a close attention to their student with a visit each semester and a private meeting with each student to check up on them. They give also rewards each semester for those who perform well that ranges from ( 500$ to 1000$) depending on their GPA. At the last summer of your study, they refer their student to some of the large companies in U.S to do an internship.

Pros
Excellent benefits package, great community life, good schools, safe quiet surroundings, exposure to different cultures, good salary, interesting work and plenty of it. Great vacation package and easy to reach superb and exotic destinations (e.g., India, Nepal, China, Philippines, Thialand, other Gulf States, etc.). Friendly people. 401K is matched by company at 9%, retirement pension is outstanding and rare in today's corporate world. Can take lump sum payment at early retirement (10 years service and over 50 years of age).
Cons
You are away from the US. Some people find this disconcerting at first, but it does lessen with time. Prices in community are rising. Some communication problems. Some restrictions on daily westernized lifestyle.

";"The current head of IA who has been leading since 2019 is a complete psychopath. Many extremely talented people (both local and expats) have left because of him and those who are still around are either not good enough to move or praying for miracle. Anyone thinking of joining, please think it over and if possible talk to someone who recently left (there are many) as otherwise you may end up in a very toxic environment.

131;Aramco;2021-09-12;Mechanical Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Burn(ing) out;"1. Good salary 2. Ample vacation time (especially if your coming from America) 3. Job security (if your a Saudi) I’m not an expat but I would say aramco is pretty great for late career expats.
";"1. Locals will be privileged. Expats will go nowhere from their hired positions. 2. Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is. More landmines to get dinged by whenever the umpteenth priority 1 item simply can’t be dealt with in the expected manner - time and qualitatively comprehensively. The priority changes on a daily basis at any given hour sometimes even 2-3 times a day.

You CANNOT escape this situation, once you complain they will make your life miserable and force you out, Performance Management System is rigged against Expats, doesn't matter how hard you work you WILL get an E or an M if you say no to a Saudi, period. Saudis in Saudi Aramco feel they can do whatever they want, Slavery and Indentured Servitude still exists in Saudi Arabia, that culture has translated into Saudi Aramco. DO NOT WORK HERE!

221;Aramco;2021-06-06;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Avoid at all costs if you’re seeking career progression;"Practically none. Money does not = satisfaction.
";"Where to begin?! If you’re seeking career progression as an expat you’re most certainly coming for the wrong reasons. The company appear to believe that money = satisfaction. If you’re an expat my advice is don’t bother. They simply don’t care about your happiness nor utilising their staff to their full potential. They want to be seen as an ‘employer of choice’, yet when people are keen to contribute to the company and move into new roles they don’t support you at all. I appreciate that there’s a push for Saudization, however the company is losing vital knowledge and real-world experience by not actively engaging many of their expat staff, and we’re treated as being expendable. I can safely say that’s exactly how I’ve been treated. Time to start looking elsewhere… the cons far outweigh the benefits for me at this point.

";"Leave what often not approved till last minute (difficult holiday planning). No career advancement for expats (maybe one promotion if you are lucky and on good relations with your management and you have exposure to Senior Management) - if not forget any promotions as these go to locals. Expected to travel to work sites at moments notice. During construction in PMT you are at the site which can be anywhere in the Kingdom. You will either be transferred OR begin FIFO (which is 5 days on, 2 days off). Very little regard for family/work life balance. Working in PMT suits bachelor more than family status. Often having to leave office to take kids to doctor/dental appointments, etc was frowned upon.

";"The camps can be isolating, don't expect any promotion as an ex-pat. You're only here to do the grunt work and help train the younger engineers, nothing else. The bonus is small compared to US companies, the yearly increase is also small. Don't try to fix anything, make anything more efficient or get ahead, the local employees will not stick up for you so don't stick your neck out trying to improve operations. The culture at work is very hierarchical, you cannot do anything without your young local supervisor's approval. No dental or eye coverage for the medical.

";"The Secretary duties are very boring, you mostly make tea/coffee and fill bowls with nuts abd spend your days correcting english on letters only to be told its incorrect by people who do not speak fluent english! There is little or no scope for progression. If you get based in a remote area it can be very isolating. The accomodation is old and mould infested. As a newbie you enter on lowest points so are not entitled to a newer build. You have no control over what Manager/Department you get assigned to or what city you end up in. Most Managers are difficult. You will experience some form of disrespect. You will be spoken to like a piece if rubbish. They are allowed to comment on your weight, too fat/too skinny. HR will ignore complaints. If you flirt and laugh at others misfortune you will be fine. You get no training and no assistance on their systems, you are just expected to know how they work. Camp life can get boring very quickly unless you go to parties all of the time. That novelty soon wears off. People are not very friendly, most of the expats are nuts. This can really get a person down as its constant negativity. There are some decent ones but few and far between. ""Wasta"" is still very much a way of life there.

386;Aramco;2020-09-22;Human Resources Advisor;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Saudi Aramco in Dhahran;"A pleasing community to live in camp. Pleasantville Arizona... Don't rely on getting across to Bahrain easily, as so are 40,000 others - and it really doesn't have much to offer. Lot's of interesting projects to work on, with very nice Saudis. Warm and pleasant, humorful and non-judgmental. Surrounded by well educated and generally pleasant colleagues from all over the world, who have a great community social life. Everything is only 5 minutes away if you live in camp. Opportunities abound for those who are willing to be agile, productive and positive. A good and surprisingly large hospital, in the camp. Many excellent Saudi staff, surgeons etc.
";"Many people will arrive on there first day at work to be told that they don't have the role they've been contacted for. Bit frustrating after a year to get gain the position and actually get there. Managers move around and the info doesn't always get to the replacement. You still get paid though. If your managers really don't want you after you have arrived, they may play the 'don't give her any work' game. Then as you have been sitting around twiddling your thumbs they'll call you in on your 90th day and tell you that you've failed probation because you haven performed, so go home again and pack. Managers often can't make decisions and don't read for more than 30 seconds - which may mean a shift in your expectations - or you can just allow it to irritate you; or you can just carry on and smile. The camp families tend to be a bit cliquey, so if you don't fit their social circle you could be politely avoided. Specific religious beliefs, married or single, that kind of clique. Don't expect a reference when you leave - they just don't give you one, unless you personally request from a friendly manager. It's difficult to come back into the real world if you have been there for 5 years or more, as your overseas experience will be probably ignored by recruiters.

";"If you get assigned to a difficult Manager it will negatively impact your overall experience. As a Westerner you may encounter disrespect and resentment. The Secretary role duties can be very mundane and there is very little scope for progression. You may be working in a building away from the main area which can feel isolating, with no canteen or few expats. Life on camp is ok, if bland. It is compound life and you do get used to it, but it can feel very enclosed. The houses are somewhat dated, but they are ok. Some expats (there are some exceptions, thankfully!) are surprisingly not that welcoming and friendly. Weather is very hot from April to October, particularly in June, July and August. Finally, it is a 'lucky dip' to which department you get assigned to. A good/bad Manager can make/break the experience.

";"Honestly, Aramco in general is a hostile working environment. They speak of 'great initatives' however, do not expect to see those initiatives come to life. Women are not valued (Saudi and expat), the performance rating scale is forced - if you are not a favorite, don't expect a good annual bonus. Many say the salary is great however, content is required. The salaries are higher than most companies - if you look outside the Oil/Gas industry. However, compared to other national oil/gas companies around the world, compensation is standard. Again, this is coming from an HR Business Partner - who has visibility to everything behind closed doors at the senior management level. No, I am not a bitter employee, I actually receive great performance reviews. However, my high performance reviews do not make me oblivious to my surroundings or oblivious to the struggles of my colleagues.

";"Benefits and salary are good for a reason. You will be disrespected continuously in the work environment as a expat. They are not interested in your experience or background, knowledge or skills. They are looking for ""workers"" who do what told to get the work done since the locals cannot and will not. Don't expect to be treated fairly or equally. Don't expect integrity and accountability for locals. Credit for your work will be given to locals - they are masters at manipulating the systems and management. Management is clueless, most have no background in the areas they manage, don't care as most stay in a position for a few months (revolving door). If you are interviewing for jobs in Learning Support and Solutions (LSSD), Academic Programs and Partnerships (AP&P) or Program Development and Evaluation (PD&ED) run away - the work environment is horrific, discriminatory, tons of locals with no skills, and incompetent management. Don't believe anything you are told. Lying is the norm as is manipulation.

550;Aramco;2019-02-19;IT Network Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;IT Engineer;"This is best place to work for an IT professional in my opinion. There are always huge IT projects being conducted. Saudi Aramco lives and thrives on IT Technology. There always opportunity to establish yourself in the field. Although, career advancement is limited, financial compensation and benefits are very rewarding. If work in Saudi Arabia, you can easily travel around the world, when vacation comes. Another huge advantage is that the workplace here is very harmonious. No backtalk or politicking in the workplace is allowed. The meals at the dining halls of Saudi Aramco are all gourmet and subsidized by Saudi Aramco and offered at a low cost to employees and contractors. Saudi Aramco has personnel from all over the world. It is great multicultural environment to work in. Saudi Aramco is unparalleled in my opinion.
";"Do not expect a direct promotion here. You do your job and pass on your expertise to young Saudis. There are no deadwood jobs here anymore like in the old times. You can use your free time to gain new skills and then apply for other job opportunities within the Company. Lookout for new projects that can enhance your career and help you move up.

If your a expat and think your gonna move up the career ladder, don't your not that's just how it goes over here. As far as training goes you don't get any mostly reserved for the local population. Seems like we do the same thing many times in row hoping for a different result.......scary. Definitely a blame culture for sure if you are a expat....go figure. As far as it goes for now you will never get hired direct only contractors so you can never take advantage of the benefits, so there is really no reason to come over truly a waste of time effort and energy its just a new game and you really don't want to be the expat slave because that's what you will be I promise.

";"Its hard to believe you are working for the most valuable company in the world! Financial incentives are diminishing every year due to following: 1. Increasing  Saudi taxes you are expected to pay lump sum while other companies pay them on behalf of their employees. 2. Bring you over from a foreign country and make you pay full rent & bills (electric etc.) of housing in the camp. 3. Education allowance no longer covers full education fees because ""they phased out the grandfather system"" and schools are increasing fees substantially. 4. You are responsible for paying visas (the right to go in and out of a country you are a resident in!) Also rising.... 5. Incremental annual increases are way below tge very high rates if inflation Saudi Arabia is experiencing. 6. There is a wide gap between US employees and ""other"" nationalities who are treated in every aspect as 2nd class even if you work harder and better at your job than your American counterpart. When you add all these costs and compare them against current salaries the incentive to move from another country and work for SA diminish.

625;Aramco;2018-05-28;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Insane benefits, and above average compensation that’s all;"The compensation was good if you’re an expatriate and benefits also crazy good. Your paycheck hits on time and the expatriates overseas that have been there for 7-10 years make it bearable. International contacts are also good.
";"They locals mostly lie through their teeth, don’t know how to do anything, raises are non existent and not based on anything close to reality. A lot of good expatriates come in being honest but you eventually start committing fraud to the terms of millions of dollars of ill gotten gains. When I took proof of this and filed the report with internal audit personally their response was to write it off to lack of Saudi experience. Amazingly when the auditors followed up with me three years in a row about the same issues that I delineated point by point in an e-mail with attached proof I finally gave up. When they acknowledged my e-mail year 1 is due to incompetence, year 2 (assuming the auditors outliners the issues in year 1 should not occur in year 2. If the same issues occur in year 3 & 4 that clearly tells you everything you need to know. From a career perspective there is literally zero growth whatsoever. Long story short stay away it’s not worth the sacrifice unless you’re exactly 49.5 years old and can arrive for day 1 prior to 50. If you can hang on for 10 years and you’ll leave with roughly $2.5MM USD in post tax savings and healthcare for life at about $400 / month for you and your spouse. This last part might change as I’ve heard they’ve been cutting back a lot over the past two years since I left. Of all the departments within Aramco New Business Development and Procurement were the worst. Corporate Planning at least tried to be runr pforessionally. The problem in Corporate Planning is that most answers were preordained before the Management Committee meetings even took place to make a formal go or no go decision.

Pros
Low stress work environment - can get away with doing little or nothing. Lifestyle for US expatriates in Dhahran are outstanding - like living at a resort. Compensation per unit of work output, is very high (not because pay is high, but required work output is very low).
Cons
Down side is that your professional skills will atrophy, rendering you unemployable anywhere else. Great place to retire from; horrible as a stepping stone to something better.

Great benefits. Chevron really cares about its people. Great people to work with.
";"Company moves very slowly and very process driven. There seem to be constant efforts to reorganize or change existing processes. Some detachment between upper level management and folks lower down; we are told our input matters but its hard to see. Slow to adapt to the new realities of the energy industry.

108;Chevron;2021-07-19;Corporate Position;Current Employee, more than 8 years;bureaucratic mess, good benefits;"Decent salary and good benefits. People are generally nice. Can be really cushy if you're OK just doing the minimum to get a good review/bonus. I think the happiest people are the ones who find a sweet spot and ride things out for a long period (long-term benefits are great).
";"We're in a slowly dying industry and lack a clear direction forward. This is reflected in our inability to attract and retain talent from top universities. Think to yourself, why would an engineer from Stanford go to Chevron instead of a tech firm? Internally, we have an exhausting bureaucracy that is highly political and difficult to navigate. At the heart, this is an engineering company, and it is presumed that engineers can do anything. In an era of changing dynamics and enormous pressure from investors and policymakers to move away from fossil fuels, the old school engineer mentality could end up being our downfall. If you're not an engineer (i.e., you're a market analyst, economist, climate person) I'd recommend staying away--you're career path will likely be limited here, and you'll be frustrated by the slow pace, extra work to deal with enormous overhead, and lack of clarity on our goals.

There is no employee break room, so you'll have to hang out in the soapy Joe's break room, There is no room for promotion, even one of the other cashier's that has been here for 4 years makes the same amount as someone working there for 1 year, due to the owner wanting to save more money in his pocket. Even everything in the store went up by .30 cents and the gas a few months ago was $4.19 to $4.79. I have a bad feeling this store will be going out of business in the next 2 years.

Management/leadership team members is approachable/accessible and 'part of the team'. Management acts with integrity. Generally supportive of employee development. Amazingly supportive for an oil company (HQ in California and you can tell).
";"Very buttoned down and bland culture. All the personality has been scrubbed out...just not that fun on a day to day basis. Some of the office locations are so boring. Too quiet, no chatter, few friendships. Career path is mostly self directed...it's on you to figure out how to climb the ladder. Despite all the talk about diversity & inclusion there has not been much progress. Management team isn't really interested in 'diversity of thought' and don't appreciate opinions that run counter to management strategies. An amazing lack of spine when it comes to managing employees who aren't getting the job done.

";"1. There is a lot of old mentalities regarding how the plant should run. Need a 1 track mind for this. 2. Also leadership styles are different that things can vary so much from supervisor, shift, and message received to the operators and contractors. 3. The previous owner of this refinery left an impact on the work force and the reliability of the plant. leading to disconnect between leadership and operations. 4. The safety for now is almost non existent. There needs to be a bigger role in training and actual safety personnel to make this successful.

The reorg was not well thought out in terms of how to execute Too many consultants with a foothold without knowing our company.

As an external hire who has spent a number of years here, I can say this place is as good as your manager and perhaps worse since the opportunities to switch roles seems to have dried up with the org changes.

";"Very low pay for the job. An average DSM makes roughly 120k-150k. Other companies are 200k+. The benefits are now horrible to keep up dividends for shareholders. Old timers said the company was lower paying but had job security compared to other O&G jobs, not anymore. Layoffs every 3-4 years for field staff. The field will have promotion freezes and layoffs but all the office staff sits safely in their positions or even promotions amid field layoffs. Finally they are so woke for diversity and inclusion that they discriminate against white males. The company went from one of the best to work for to one of the worst. Chevron is a typical woke, liberal, California company.

It's almost painful sometimes and several lifelong Chevron employees don't realize how great they have it. You're also working with a large number of capable people who want to do good work. In my experience, if those that are only a few months away from retirement still put in significant effort. They want the company and the people there to succeed.
";"I don't think this is unique to Chevron, more a consequence of being a large company with long-tenured employees - in many groups voicing disagreement or new ideas has to be done very skillfully or you can come off as 'a jerk' even if it would be considered fairly polite at other companies. It's a very heavy 'nice' culture that can slow things down.

";"Like many corporations, Chevron is bending the knee to the ""Social Justice"" movement. This means that the workforce is being atomized and pitted against itself. Reference Chevron's press releases from earlier this year crowing about how personnel reductions at upper levels had disproportionately affected white men. This trend can be linked to some large investors very loudly proclaiming a focus on so-called ""ES&G"" metrics. This also brings about an irrational focus on ""going green"". Up until a year or so ago, I was proud to see Chevron was resisting the industry trend of mouthing the ""Carbon is bad"" mantra. This has flipped and quickly in the last year. Terrible for morale

468;Chevron;2020-11-15;Finance Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Not the Company it Once Was;"In general the benefits are pretty good. The company focuses on safety. A fairly good work life balance, but constant downsizings have eroded some of this. The company has many employee networks to improve employee experience. The company is trying to take care of the thousands of employees being laid off.
";"I hate to say it, but avoid this company like the plague. I used to love working for Chevron, but now I’m just trying to hang on until retirement. Constant downsizing has destroyed the previous collaborative culture. It is now a dog eat dog company. Politics rule all decisions. Personnel decisions are based on favoritism and cliques. If you do not have a powerful sponsor, prepare for a lousy job or a target on your back for the next downsizing. The focus is on cost cutting and improving the bottom line. This is a declining industry and management has not made any meaningful changes to embrace a lower-carbon future. If you are in any service function your job will be automated or outsourced to Philippines or Argentina. If you are a petrotech, it’s still not too bad, but if you have a long career left, get out of O&G. Retrain yourself. We are coming through a massive downsizing and will probably have another in less than two years.

Middle management is generally out of touch with how the world has changed and do a bad job of aligning incentives and good work. Career progression is slow, stable, and steady, like it's the 1950s or something. Doesnt feel like good performance is rewarded. Everyone is just collecting a paycheck. There is no passion for what you do (I mean, it is oil and gas). It feels like the older managers and generation are just trying to get to retirement.

581;Chevron;2020-09-12;Engineer;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Definitely a good place to start a career...;"For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.
";"Weak opportunities for non-engineers. If you aren't an engineer, expect to spend your career mostly in the same place and at best climbing the ladder only one or two rungs. Repeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: ""If you don't move, you don't matter"". Once you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents. Under CEO Mike Wirth, Chevron has gone all-in on ""woke"" politics, in an especially ham-fisted way. If you aren't inclined towards PC culture, you'll need to learn to fake it or at least stay very silent. Race and gender are increasingly major factors in hiring and promotion, which may or may not benefit you.

It's a program that ideally will help with molding a better culture that will eliminate the ""good 'ol boy"" mentality in Oil & Gas industry.
";"Current internal hiring process/career development programs are not as inclusionary as it could be, specifically within the IT world. Too many ""badly behaving"" managers are being promoted and allowed to continue to bully or mistreat their direct reports. If you're an admin and have a brain and want to get promoted, stay away from the IT groups here.

Good base salaries if you are willing to forget all ethics and be a ""my way or the highway"" supervisor or employee.
";"The company advertises multiple career opportunities but then management or supervisors limit career growth for their departments and direct reports. Chevron brands themselves as a diverse and equal opportunity employer, yet supervisors do not preach what they say and will limit their employees in order to keep good people in their team instead of letting them excel in other job opportunities within the company. Many supervisors have a control issue. If you say one thing, they will make you do the opposite just so they can be right. I have heard from peers that the HR hotline number is useless, only creates more trouble and should never be used even though the company promotes the hotline. Inflexible work schedule. The company promotes work life balance yet the decisions rest in your supervisor's personnel interpretation of work life balance. No room for working remotely and your vacation plans are expected to be changed per the supervisor's request for internal fictitious corporate deadlines.

Work hard. Believe they are setting the right culture (but it isn't being carried out at lower levels)
";"It's the senior- and mid-level managers in Communications who are clinging to the old boys network, tapping the same (mostly white men) for plumb assignments and passing over better qualified candidates for the favored few. You lose your value the minute you walk in the door and they put you under some manager promoted to a role he has no business running. Once inside, promotions for those outside the inner circle are few and far between. Ranking in communications is based on personality and politics instead of hard work and real enterprise value. Employee surveys are massaged to keep the functional leads in control.

769;Chevron;2019-07-17;Customer Service Representative;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Without a doubt I highly recommend;"I recommend this job to anyone. If anyone is thinking of applying to this job go for it but make sure it's for a corporate station. I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back)
";"Chevron has high standards, you work your butt off. Sometimes all the rides, mystery shops, inspections can get stressful because there are SO MANY!!! I think having so much stress deserves a tad bit more of a raise.

Engaging work, interesting industry, and even without drinking the kool-aid you can recognize the impact of your work on the economy and environment. High commitment to environmental safety and goals around clean energy (despite what some media may claim). Compensation and benefits are great, which is why they keep people for so long. Lots of opportunity to rotate and learn new skills if you're proactive and network effectively. 8% 401(k) match if you contribute 2%. Pension too, which is generally unheard of for non-gov't jobs.
";"Finance teams are slowly getting caught up with technology and advanced analytics, but a lot is lip-service and patting each other on the back for using the right buzzwords. The ranking and pay determination process is archaic, and 1-2 incompetent group or line-level leaders can derail a successful employee. Many folks at early-to-mid career looking for opportunities due to lack of direction and general micromanagement. Several outright bad managers whose behavior is ignored by higher-ups.

799;Chevron;2019-03-22;Network Engineer;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Exceptionally Good Company;"The benefits package at Chevron is literally unmatched in any other company or industry that I have seen. I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance.
";"It's a very large organization which means it's somewhat bureaucratic. It actually operates as a cooperation which is mostly a negative because it is actually many independent companies working under a leadership organizations (leadership directive?) which means there are many misses in streamlining and drastically increases silos within the organization. Because of longevity of the people that work for the company (a good thing) there is a lot of mindset on outdated logic, process, and procedures, although Chevron recognized this and has been making conscience effort to migrate this and adjust this mindset. There are a lot of restructures and reorganizations within the company as the market for oil constantly shifts and adjusts.

";"- Out-dated talent management practices. They still use personnel development committees to pay and rank people, which can lead to great inefficiencies (days upon days spent going over ratings and it leads to a highly political environment while also making employees feel undervalued). It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling. There are committees for literally everything that circle around with little impact and many people on these committees feel they need to critique things for the sake of saying they made a contribution to the committee.

";"Chevron is a very process oriented company and as such it has trouble making decisions with out a lot of review. Even if the decision is a low risk/low consequence managers will agonize over the decision for months. The older days at Chevron management could make the decision on the day you asked if not in the same discussion. As employee you need to be a suckup and make no critical comments.

";"There is a joke that if someone asks a question in a meeting and no one speaks up to answer it's called a ""Chevron Yes""...so perhaps there is a perceived timidity in some divisions. I saw that sometimes. Bureaucracy...it's going to always be an issue in any large organization

865;Chevron;2018-11-16;Customer Service Representative;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Chevron Stations is one of the worst places to work. Get experience when working here, then leave to get a better job.;"First off, Chevron Stations and other departments of Chevron should be separated because they are not the same. Chevron Stations is overloaded with low salary people who slack off during work, and who don't care about their jobs. - Can slack off and do nothing while getting paid, because the managers themselves slack off themselves and let others to do so as well. - Can break practically any rule of Chevron that you want because the managers don't care if you do so or not because they don't care for the company. - Free fountain drinks.
";"- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.

";"Refinery Experience: The company has the worst business models I’ve come across. Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels. If being a 2 was not just the general population employee.

Good matching contribution to 401k. There used to be great qualities about the jobs at this company which have been all lost with bad management and poor decisions.
";"- Continuous over-hiring and laying off trend never ended over the three years putting all employees at the edge of their seats and making it a very uncomfortable environment to work at. - Bad ranking system. The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at.

Good people work here. You will like your coworkers. 8% match is great plus mega back door roth is possible.

938;Chevron;2018-05-11;Human Resources Manager;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Poor choice for experienced / high potential HR candidates;"Very high pay relative to expectations, work/life balance, golden handcuff pension, employees expected to act professional.
";"Experienced hires will be severely underchallenged and not considered for growth opportunities; Chevron HR doesn’t care about anything you learned from any other company, even though their own HR practices are weak. This is a relationship and politics based culture that views performance as secondary, which means you have no chance relative to someone who has already been there 20 years. They hold positions exclusively for people from their own development program, even though they too are often ill equipped. The Chevron Way behavioral expectations lead to a friendly but artificial and passive-avoidant culture. About 50 percent of time is spent on bureaucracy vs real HR work. If you want money with minimal effort, this is a good choice. If you want to learn, grow and become a great HR professional, avoid.

";"LOCATION: you WILL end up working in Houston, Bakersfield, or Nigeria. San Ramon is no longer an option except a couple of corporate departments, which live in constant fear that they may be moved to Houston. LAYOFFS: 30% of my unit was laid off in 2015, more were affected in the subsequent year. If you are in a wrong place at a wrong time, you are out; there is no mechanism for keeping good people. MEDIOCRITY: there is little appreciation for technical skills and work. The attitude is that being an industry leader is too risky and being a follower is safer and cheaper; we do not have the resources to work on technically challenging problems and barely have enough time to evaluate solutions provided by vendors.

104;Veolia;2020-07-11;Environmental Specialist I;Current Employee, more than 1 year;DO NOT WORK HERE;"Benefits, potential high pay and nothing else!
";"The work environment is horrible, but especially for women. This is a total good boys club and if you aren't friends with the higher ups, and drink with them then you are not getting promotions and will be put into the worst jobs/situations, and they will punish you for not ""being in the circle"". This company led me on for a year, had me doing work for a position they never intended to give me and kept stringing me along, all while promoting their friends. They don't carry themselves professionally and it's actually sad watching the way they speak to customers, they're a joke to work for and with. I do not recommend this company to anyone, but ESPECIALLY to those who have a degree. They will put you in the lowest position and try to get you to drive trucks. They're an environmental company that doesn't even recycle or have one care for their environmental impact. If you care about using your education or at least having your degree provide you with a better position than what someone with a GED would get then do not even look twice at this place. OH and if you hate nepotism then this company will drive you wild! They hire family and only take care of each other so you'll never have a position that meets your potential because they'd rather give it to someone completely incompetent than to you. If you're a women they speak poorly of you, expect you to do physically tasking work and don't stand up for you when men in the field are sexually harassing you. If they do bring anything to HR, it goes no where and nothing gets resolved. It's a toxic work environment and I hope to lead people away from experiencing anything I went through.

105;Veolia;2020-02-17;Laboratory Technician;Former Employee, less than 1 year;You don't want this job.;"Pay slightly above market rate
";"Long hours, confusion and chaos, checked out/clueless managers, negative culture have lead the laboratory to become a revolving door department. If you interview, make sure to ask them about their turnover rate, why they think it's so high, and what they plan to do to address it. During the interview they'll offer you a tour - see what a mess the lab and the lab offices are - ask yourself if this seems like a company on top of things. I accepted this position when they offered a 30% raise over my previous position, left less than a year later after the other two members of the department quit (they made it six and ten months, respectively). Accepted a position that paid 19% lower than Veolia and I'm much better off for it. Trust me, you do not want this job.

";"Around 2013 there was a visible shift. Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment. Productivity is also hurt by poor information technology, employees have to navigate different systems and locations to find what they need.

110;Veolia;2020-05-04;Environmental Specialist;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Potential for initial career advancement. Terrible management in Latham Office.;"A lot of potential for initial career advancement due to their ES I and ES II tests that you can take once you fill out a booklet with performed tasks. If you then pass the exam, which is open book, you receive a raise and become an ES II... Working onsite at different facilities can be very interesting and lead to networking and new job opportunities.
";"Extremely high turn over rate leads to low moral and the overworking of employees. Management does not provide aid to overworked employees at all. The management in Latham consistently makes false promises to employees, further depleting moral.

";"I was offered a position with Veolia in July of 2019. I completed a physical and background check in August of 2019. During the physical a doctor noted a perceived disability. After 7 months of waiting for a start date from the company they rescinded the offer of employment due to a perceived disability. Despite my previous experience in a very similar chemical plant and offers to provide documentation and other evidence to prove my experience and ability to perform the duties of the job the company pulled the offer. The company implied during a phone conversation that I hid the perceived disability and offered no reasonable accommodations. It is not the responsibility of the applicant to disclose anything that could be considered a disability or offer accommodations. Per the ADA that is the responsibility of the company.

";"Less than stellar ethics amongst several individuals in the “top” management of Veolia North America (VNA). Also, the current crop of Senior leaders have an operations background and hence see everything in operations terms. They have close to zero idea on how to grow the company (“Business Development”) and assume an operations mindset is transferable to BD. In the past 2-years, near- Constant reorganization has gutted BD; about 20-mid-to-senior BD executives (especially in the M&C group) have been summarily fired or just quit. People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management. The annual strategy meetings are an example of kiss-up, kick down. Net-net, the company is losing contracts to its competitors. Again, VNA is an OK place if you want an operations focused career. But stay away if you want to do Business Development.

";"Laboratory management loves to micromanage employees. Expect to be criticized if you do things your way. Theres a lot of gossip going around with the senior staff who bad mouth other employees. Very little to no team player effort by senior staff. They will belittle you, and information does not spread evenly through staff. You will hear differences in information within the department. The laboratory needs to work on their Environmental, Health, and Safety culture as well. Some fume hoods did not work, which leads to higher exposure of hazardous chemicals. There is favoritism as well. Little to no upward mobility within the laboratory even after I assumed more responsibility after another employee left. They will overwork you, and still won't offer you more pay. Overall, I would say the lab has a very unprofessional atmosphere and toxic work culture.

";"The energy business unit is entirely district energy focused and have no views on how to grow. The leadership in that group is simply inbred and a good number of them need to be replaced with new people who have broader views on the industries that they could grow in. Too much effort is spent on spinning a marketing story and not enough on actual resources to develop and deliver services. They could be great if they actually believed and delivered on what they print in there own brochures.

1;PGandE;2021-10-12;Anonymous;Current Employee;Full of disinterested employees who do the bare minimum;"- Good benefits include 401k match & pension.
";"- Large workload of inefficient processes - 90% of workforce is lazy & disinterested. Don't reply to emails or be productive. Just complete work ""the way it has always been done"" - ineffective, inefficient, low quality, poor documentation, no transparency. Complete bare minimum to not be terminated. Do-Nothing employees are drawn to this company like moths to a flame and the 10% who do want to invoke positive change find themselves bashing their heads against the wall day in, day out. Prepare to send 20 follow up emails & have 7 meetings to get a single thing done, waste of time. - Leadership is full of ""Yes men"" who say whatever makes them look good to executives, then don't follow through. Revolving door of executives. Lots of buzz words about tenacity & positivity & leading with love & being the change, only resulting in more busywork without any results. Re-orgs & rolling out new processes every other year is the norm - always in flux & never at performing point in implementation. - CYA culture, finger pointing, no cross-functional cooperation. - Company promises one thing then reneges, leaving employees left holding the bag.

Great benefits. Post COVID, flexibility to work from home has been great. I think there are areas where it isn't chaos but they are hard to find.
";"Two issues: 1) the CPUC and 2) internally chaotic. The company is disorganized mostly due to an unreasonable regulator (CPUC) and too many competing priorities. The company's spend has doubled but it isn't in labor, labor has been cut dramatically and work has been increased. Work life balance is an issue because it doesn't exist. I do not believe the company is going to improve for the employees. Leadership is a revolving door and I truly think the regulation of PG&E is what cripples the company. It is a bunch of regulators who have no idea how the business even works, trying to feel important. Many of the regulators do not understand the basics of a gas and electrical company yet that is where all our time is spent - explaining it to them.

Remote work because of Covid-19 has been great. Not all collogues can work remote unfortunately. Many co-workers try their best.
";"PG&E is a convicted felon. The majority of supervisors, managers, directors, etc. are extremely unqualified to lead. What I've read regarding you have to be a white male to receive advancement opportunities is complete wrong. The company will place a completely unqualified diversity candidate in a role just to meet a quota. There are whole organization with women in the C-suite all the way to the front lines. A high amount of unethical behavior is common throughout the company. ""Speak-Up"" culture is ineffective. There is limited follow-up on concerns. CAP program is used a crutch when no one has an answer who should or when a Leader will not take accountability. There are 6-7000 CAPs in this ineffective program. CEO, VPs, CFO, and Presidents are constantly changing. With this change comes non standardization and continual reorganization.

The work of providing safe gas and electricity is deeply meaningful, as you feel yourself being in integral part of enabling daily life for all your friends and neighbors. PG&E's a big company, so there's a myriad of different things to do, and the landscape around the company continues to shift rapidly which creates opportunities to re-thing the status quo, and drive change.
";"The highly regulated environment creates a risk averse, and a change averse culture. To some degree that's not a bad thing as one doesn't want their utility to be risk forward. That said, it tends to pressure people to stay in boxes, and inhibits creativity and autonomy. The external environment around the company is very negative, and the company is consistently judged unfairly by the media, and local communities.

";"Be prepared for little empowerment. I called it the ""Mother May I Company"". Way too many chiefs talking to way to many chiefs with little impact on anything. You have to ask for permission from way to many people to do anything. Get ready for a massive amount of nepotism. Tribal knowledge is a must and reserved for insiders only. Record systems are a disaster waiting to happen. Confusion is very commonplace among the rank and file. The corporate culture is to follow the ""PGE"" way regardless of how inefficient it is. Forget any form of ""Best in class"" to be implemented until it receives a good going over by the ""PGE tribal specialist"" so they can label it the ""PGE"" way. The new modified ""PGE"" best in class way usually looks nothing like the original concept. The modified ""PGE"" best in class takes so long to be deployed it will almost always be obsolete before full deployment. You have to learn how to respond to hearing things like ""Manufacturer Discontinued"".

";"Every group is a silo, no group knows what the other is doing so mistakes can happen due to lack of communication. Supervisors spy on other groups and tattle-tell if you are on the internet (even if your job requires it). People from good universities, backgrounds however this makes them pretty arrogant. Most managers and engineers refuse to work with contractors and believe they know best regardless of evidence. Company is not very transparent about issues, and cover up is another word for discretion. Most employees are blindsided by the company official attitude since the newspaper is a better source of news than the internal communication. Supervisors are known to berate their employees vs training them. Union vs non-union jobs are set against each other, and engineers are told to not even think about unionizing and to listen to their union peers so they can pass their info up to management. Benefits are mediocre, 401k contribution is the lowest I ever seen in any company, vacation time is not used up and it's loss due to managers not approving on time. Not many career opportunities, training outside of the office is discouraged and denied all the time. Conference attendance is not funded except for managers, individual contributors are not allowed to go to training or conferences.

";"As can be seen by poor wildfire management and preparation, the upper levels of management have issues doing their jobs correctly. They have a history of not listening to the workers' input until it's too late. Electrical workers were warning management about bad processes and antiquated equipment that could fail for years before the wildfires took place. Turns out profits were more important.

299;PGandE;2019-05-10;Project Management;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Morning huddle threat to Safety, Micromanage;"Company benefits. San Ramon location at Bishop Ranch.
";"Last year Gas Organization started daily huddle first thing in the morning. This causes stress and anxiety. Employees are just getting to office, still holding our purses, when we are asked what good and bad happened yesterday. This is complete waste of time. Who remembers what we did yesterday or over the weekend on Friday. Many members in our team just stand there with all their belongings and wait for it to be over so we can go to our desk and start real work. This has been complete waste of time, adding no value. Have asked management to move out the time of huddle, so at least we are able to think about the day before, go through our email...but no one listens. This is just a sneaky way for management to make sure everyone gets to office at a certain time. When is the company going to realize that we are not school kids but professionals, and don't have to be micromanaged. The huddles are not working, get rid of this, so we can be more productive, and look forward to coming to work. The morale is down in our dept. Management only talks about what matters to them, we are not able to solve any problems. You need to start treating us like professionals.

";"Always in crisis management. Doing your job you discover skeletons in PG&E's closet and the company sometimes went to great lengths to keep them quiet e.g. being asked to shred records, being told to communicate via fax because emails could be traced, and being trained face-to-face by lawyers to practice being grilled. These examples were not everyday occurrences, but they happened and they belittled your soul. I left on my own terms, but I am proud to have always questioned and challenged internal management who tried to keep us quiet - I was tired of always having to push things far enough into the public eye to make a difference. I had to keep a special file of my emails notifying legal or safety of potential issues - doing my job, I was sometimes fearful about what I discovered.

";"At this point in the company it is difficult with limited resources.

308;PGandE;2020-04-02;Compliance Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Re: If you're not union or management, leave. You've been warned;"Their pension and 401k back then was among the best in any industry. Many volunteer opportunities Lot of job shadowing and mentor ship opportunities as well Many of the employees there were really cool people. Management on the other hand have become a toxic club. They encouraged zero empathy. They are so far from their advertised culture, it's not funny.
";"If you're not part of the union, you will get the short end of the stick on raises, bonuses, and anything else. They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.

319;PGandE;2019-07-08;Senior Cyber Security Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Good pay, bad mgmt, no flexibility to work remote;"Pay is above average for cyber security roles. Hour expectaions are low, meaning theres little pressure to complete work quickly (until theres a crisis). I have a lot of autonomy. Even with the bankruptcy, am fairly secure in my position. Little outsourcing to other geographies.
";"All of my observations apply to IT and Cybersecurity only. Average output and work ethic in these groups is extremely low. Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours. Facilities outside of San Francisco are often very basic or even shoddy. If considering a position outside of SF, make sure to tour the work site. Being outside of SF is also a career disadvantage unless your work site is a center for your org.

Low caliber of employees and leaders, easy to produce ""good work"". Can arrive at 10 and leave at 3 everyday with an hour lunch no questions asked.
";"Besides being roughly 50% owned by hedge funds at the moment (never a good thing for a public utility to be owned by an entity that simply wants to make a profit, its counter to the business model), the first item of note is the fact that internal politics and bureaucracy are pushed to the extreme here. The company lacks controls and accountability and believe me, people take advantage. There are good people but few and far between. Many people do virtually nothing all day long. The company in general talks a big game of ""change"" but utterly unwilling to do so in practice. Status quo rules here, how many times did I hear ""don't rock the boat"". Morale is low, employees are generally unfriendly. Lots of older, legacy staff who still believe the company's modus operandi is that of the 1980's, i.e. telling you not to ask them a question where they have to think and find someone else. A general lack of problem solving ability, will to do so, and execution. You must review safety procedures before every meeting, which gets condescending and repetitive. We are all adults, it should be assumed we know how to climb stairs,etc without instructions how to do so at nauseaum. Rampant nepotism and favoritism. Horrible, decrepit facilities akin to the DMV. Lots of older employees preparing to retire with institutional knowledge not handed down to the next generation. In summary, this place is a disaster, no wonder they are constantly dealing with the PR disaster de jour.

333;PGandE;2016-02-11;Field Engineer;Current Employee;I'm here to stay;"PG&E is one of few companies left that offer a pension to employees. On top of the above average benefits one normally sees at a career level job, PG&E offers multiple additional resources and perks such as discounts and complimentary services, too many to mention. Example being a discount on the utility bill (25% off - if it's with PG&E), Major cell carrier bill discounts, travel, loans, commodities etc. PG&E really cares about health and well being and strives to reduce work related injuries (from desk jobs to field work) by offering ergonomic assessments and equipment to reduce fatigue.
";"Being a big corporation, change moves slowly and bureaucracy is common gossip around the office. When there is change, it's usually across the board which is both disruptive and can put people out of positions even if their performance is exemplary since they are now a gold plated square peg for a round hole. Though upper management (which there is many layers of) does put effort to reposition these employees its can sometime be hard for the peons to get themselves heard with results.

Sadly, it often feels like a waste of time because none of it ever actually gets used. Most training seem to be so that they can check the box and say they offered it.
";"Criteria for raise, promotion are murky at best. Managers themselves do not understand it well and are not able to explain it well enough to be understood. Often times, questions posed are not answered and although they promise to come back with the information, they usually do not.

One had a 9/80 schedule, while the other didn’t bat an eye if you worked 50-60 hours/week.
";"ESC union employees were paid way more than normal employees which was very discouraging that we were treated as second class employees. Leadership was very poor in general in gas.

The worst part of it is that they have to train their replacements; otherwise, they have to walk out without a severance package. They are doing this in stages so it does not trigger the interest of the media. They call this action Reorganization in order to mask what they are really doing. If you want to play politics, they may let you stay there. However, if you're there just to do your job as a professional, good luck.

"
379;PGandE;2017-09-04;Principal Business Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Not in a good place.;"-The people you work with are great and one of the reasons why I stayed as long as I did. There's alot of smart and passionate people there with alot of years of experience. For people that are new to the industry it's a great opportunity to learn from experts. For the most part people have no problem sharing their knowledge with you, all it takes is a coffee or lunch every now and then. -Easily accessible location from East Bay... Peninsula side not so much.
";"-Out of touch. Their business will continue to shrink because of all the CCA's and renewables eating into their market share. Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.

In the last couple of years, the strategy at BP was changed to pursue renewables and move away from Oil. If that is your thing, enjoy.
";"BP tends to send many jobs offshore and that trend will continue. They are also moving to automate many processes. Reducing headcount is a strategy at BP. It can often feel heartless and sterile to see people who have devoted many years in service to the company to be quietly laid off. There are many who see a downward trend at BP in terms of future earnings potential given that they intend to move away from Oil. This is a concern for both investors and employees.

27;BP;08/01/2021;Category Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Beware of BP;"The work is interesting and the coworkers are generally friendly. I was always paid on time.
";"You should be aware that BP has an official program that involves paying financial incentives to managers when diversity targets are met for women and/or Black employees. If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often.

Run away if you're a geoscientist;"Pretty good work-life balance, good benefits, good severance package (for now). Lots of smart and talented people, at least where I worked. Good diversity and inclusion.
";"Recent layoffs have gutted the company, leaving it understaffed and lacking experience. The transformation to an Agile work environment means staff are deployed on projects and seem to rush to get work done during the sprints. This might lead to the 80% solution becoming the 50% solution. New CEO bernard looney has re-imagined bp by transforming it into a utility company and shrinking oil and gas production 40% by 2030, and even less by 2050. The end result is that if you're a geoscientist and want a career in oil & gas, you should see working at bp as a dead-end and start looking for a new employer. In exploration, every new discovery is another step closer to making your job redundant. Upward mobility was challenging before the reorganization, so in order to advance people were leaving exploration to go to other companies. Now, it will be even harder. The latest layoffs were done in an opaque manner.

If you are self serving, selfish manager wannabe, BP is right for you, and they love young, stupid or cheap. They talk the talk all day, don't walk the walk. Culture hasn't changed since Deep Water Horizon, Texas City, etc. Same dumb outsourcing strategies never end. Phony new goals are the same thin veil - digitize and zero carbon.

";"Very poor management coming from London. No good idea can ever come from outside the UK. The last 10 years, every decision made has had bad repercussion on the business, workers and knowledge depletion and yet shareholders keep getting paid at the expense of workers. Higher ups are a closed club and they only promote within their restricted group. New CEO fooled everyone with his supposed ""in touch with workers"" attitude when in reality he is ruthless and is totally out of touch with reality. He spent ""Tweeting or Yammering"" instead of truly running the business (reminds me of TRUMP). Managers are promoted based on who you know and not what you accomplish. Some managers are sooooooo bad that they keep bouncing from one division to the other wrecking havoc but never get fired. In general this organization is absolutely terrible at running assets....hence everytime they sold one, the new owners made out really well and ran that assets 100% better than when it was in BP's hands. This is all due to too much red tape. I view this organization as an oil tanker that takes forever to make a turn while it's competitors are more nimble and are more like frigates. The last 10 years, BP went through 5 reorg all by reducing headcounts or selling assets. The organization is just too lean to function properly and is constantly trying to put up fires that get started because of the lack of bodies/personnel.

227;BP;07/07/2020;Commercial Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Great people, good salary good benefits, very poor management and poor outlook;"A lot of very skilled workers (level G and below). Great Benefits and good pay. Good diversity and hard working people.
";"Very poor management coming from London. No good idea can ever come from outside the UK. The last 10 years, every decision made has had bad repercussion on the business, workers and knowledge depletion and yet shareholders keep getting paid at the expense of workers. Higher ups are a closed club and they only promote within their restricted group. New CEO fooled everyone with his supposed ""in touch with workers"" attitude when in reality he is ruthless and is totally out of touch with reality. He spent ""Tweeting or Yammering"" instead of truly running the business (reminds me of TRUMP). Managers are promoted based on who you know and not what you accomplish. Some managers are sooooooo bad that they keep bouncing from one division to the other wrecking havoc but never get fired. In general this organization is absolutely terrible at running assets....hence everytime they sold one, the new owners made out really well and ran that assets 100% better than when it was in BP's hands. This is all due to too much red tape. I view this organization as an oil tanker that takes forever to make a turn while it's competitors are more nimble and are more like frigates. The last 10 years, BP went through 5 reorg all by reducing headcounts or selling assets. The organization is just too lean to function properly and is constantly trying to put up fires that get started because of the lack of bodies/personnel.

Cons
After learning the basics, most of the engineering effort is centered around conforming to existing BP standards and following specs instead of thinking critically. There is so much bureaucracy that it is easier to just follow the specs than to do anything else, even if the specs create a more expensive and difficult solution

";"Big global company that at times is too top heavy to make decisions. Can be a large disconnect between local business units central teams (people in London and Houston don’t always know how oil and gas production works and the ramifications and effort it takes to deliver what is asked). Also BP likes to change, saying around here goes “if you don’t like something, wait two years, it’ll change.” Can’t learn from mistakes, constantly changing systems to new systems that don’t work properly, unsupported and don’t meet requirements. Have now started rolling out new enterprise systems that don’t work properly for weeks after launch and with no actual training on how they work. Employees are expected to just figure it for themselves. Lots debt and expenses from oil spill, oil price downturn and buying assets has led them to sell current assets.

312;BP;22/02/2009;Petroleum Engineer;Current Employee;Delivers work/life balance, but red tape and processes still prevail over common business sense.;"Flex fridays and casual office environment and culture generally live up to warm and fuzzy, good work life balance image, although flex fridays have been taken away from some groups in other areas of the company. Vacation time relatively weak compared to competition, but management in generally flexible if there are family issues that limit your work availability. Salary is reasonable, but much better can be had in industry, new bonus structure is good (if you have a good relationship with your supervisor), disappointing otherwise. Benefits are solid. Worldwide work locations with opportunities for advancement if you toe the company line and keep your opinion to yourself.
";"Alot of processes and red tape, trumping common sense more often than not. It's often unclear who is accountable and who makes decisions with constantly shifting management priorities. Too many layers of management that are reorganized and shuffled every 12 to 18 months and regularly roll out non-value adding initiatives that create a ton of work for technical staff, get some manager a promotion, and leave unrealistic expectations for the next manager. Internal job postings are ""just for show"", new roles and promotion opportunities are largely pre-determined and based on diversity and politics rather than merit. Alot of dead weight across the org charts, with several good people having left recently.

333;BP;23/01/2019;Reservoir Engineer;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Incompetence at its maximum, no upward movement for those who are not the favorites;"Pay (and that's about it)
";"This place is teeming with incompetent employees, especially managers. BP goes out of its way to protect incompetent managers that waste the company hundreds of millions of dollars instead of sacking them. The company is very clique-y and if you're not part of the ones that managers like, even if you do your job well, the managers will make sure to get rid of you and replace you with one of their buddies. It's very dogmatic and behind the times. BP is not a leader in the industry, it's a follower. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they just keep reworking the same problem over and over with the same mindset and never find a solution to anything. Anyone that tries to challenge dogma and come up with new ideas is considered a trouble-maker and someone that rocks the boat. Management doesn't want anyone to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems, even though they say ad nauseam that they do, because God forbid that someone exposes their incompetence. All they want is complacent worker bees that keep their heads down and brown nose managers' insatiable egos. No wonder Exxon and the other majors think of BP as a joke. When this company continues to compare their performance to those of the minors instead of the majors, you know there's something seriously wrong. Instead of improving their standards, they just set the bar very low.

";"It's very team dependent. You can love one team, and dislike the next. Your manager really makes or breaks your experience. As with any large company it is very political and hard to get things done in a timely manner as it has to go through many different departments to get approval. A lot of the older people at the company are just completely content working 8-4 with a decent salary and good benefits and have zero sense of urgency to get anything done, so as a younger professional trying to make a name for yourself that can be extremely frustrating.

Add to that the fact that situations were often worsened considerably, instead of de-escalated, by the inclusion of the managers/owners input made me feel unsafe working there on numerous occasions. Several other employees were given anxiety attacks due to the exploits of the managers/owners, leading to the point that I was the only employee currently working for them across ALL of their stores (the rest were family members). I am scheduled to be shuttled off to a much smaller, failing store to work due to their apparent want to get me to quit, even when my car is shared between multiple people and me traveling sizable distances mean that one of us cannot get to work.

";"This company has too many mid-level managers. Everything decision or action takes 3 meetings. There are managers, directors and VP's that have managers or team leads just to go to meetings. The ethics and management approach to Macondo Well disaster is indicative of how this company runs day to day. This company always operates in the grey area of ethics. The attitude is not what is right, but what can we get away with and what will it cost if we get caught. Most of the top talent leaves after vesting because of the toxic atmosphere. This is a company living in the old world of cronyism. It is not what you know, but who you know.

";"This place is teeming with incompetent employees, especially managers. BP goes out of its way to protect incompetent managers that waste the company hundreds of millions of dollars instead of sacking them. The company is very clique-y and if you're not part of the ones that managers like, even if you do your job well, the managers will make sure to get rid of you and replace you with one of their buddies. It's very dogmatic and behind the times. BP is not a leader in the industry, it's a follower. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they just keep reworking the same problem over and over with the same mindset and never find a solution to anything. Anyone that tries to challenge dogma and come up with new ideas is considered a trouble-maker and someone that rocks the boat. Management doesn't want anyone to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems, even though they say ad nauseam that they do, because God forbid that someone exposes their incompetence. All they want is complacent worker bees that keep their heads down and brown nose managers' insatiable egos. No wonder Exxon and the other majors think of BP as a joke. When this company continues to compare their performance to those of the minors instead of the majors, you know there's something seriously wrong. Instead of improving their standards, they just set the bar very low.

";"It's very team dependent. You can love one team, and dislike the next. Your manager really makes or breaks your experience. As with any large company it is very political and hard to get things done in a timely manner as it has to go through many different departments to get approval. A lot of the older people at the company are just completely content working 8-4 with a decent salary and good benefits and have zero sense of urgency to get anything done, so as a younger professional trying to make a name for yourself that can be extremely frustrating.

Add to that the fact that situations were often worsened considerably, instead of de-escalated, by the inclusion of the managers/owners input made me feel unsafe working there on numerous occasions. Several other employees were given anxiety attacks due to the exploits of the managers/owners, leading to the point that I was the only employee currently working for them across ALL of their stores (the rest were family members).

";"One of the worst poorly run and managed companies I have ever worked for. The management does not care about their people. They hire friends that are highly under qualified. Which in turn results in horrible working conditions for everyone else. It is one of the most toxic, demoralizing environments I have ever seen. They downsize and get rid of people they don't like or that have the gall to voice opinions and then re-organize and rehire new people. Their value statements are all lies.

459;BP;2018-04-08;Human Resources Manager;Former Employee, more than 3 years;HR Leader;"Competitive benefits. Some locations in the US have very strong employee engagement and culture. The further the locations are from the main ""hubs"" (Chicago and Houston) the more engaged and productive they seem to be. The only exception to this is Supply and Trading.
";"I can only speak for US downstream business. Some leaders are unethical. They seem to be untouchable because they get the jobs done. There is little attention on ""how"" they get things done. Leadership development seems very weak, disorganized and sometimes just ""on mute"". Very shortsighted in this realm.
"
460;BP;2013-10-07;Team Leader;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Not the company it once was;"BP is a large company, and tries to be one with good values. In the past BP was a company where a strong meritocracy culture prevailed. However, its strength was its weakness, which means a lack of strong business processes allowed for employee room to create as you figured things out. Some would argue this is why we had so many industrial accidents.
";"Following Macondo, it has become more of ""do the right thing for BP"" instead of ""do the right thing"" -- its a subtle but important change. Combine this with weak business processes, and you can imagine the slippery slope when less scrupulous managers acquire power. This is important to understand if you are thinking of entering an employment relationship with BP.

461;BP;2016-07-13;Materials and Welding Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;A House Divided;"Fairly relaxed, flexible hours, 9/80 schedule, easy to convince others that you are an expert in a particular area or product.
";"Company is in a constant state of flux and reorganization. Project Management side of the business wants to make change in culture but doesn't follow through on supporting other segments of the organization (engineering in particular). Even though there have been quite a few layoffs seems most of the folks let go were the productive people and an overwhelming amount of dead weight is still around. The company management structure is more like office space with no clear directive on a day to day which makes it tough to make progress on anything.
"
462;BP;2011-09-30;Subsea Engineer;Former Employee;Great place to learn and get a deep perspective on the industry;"BP is a great place to start a career. They will train you, expose you to many different aspects/places in the E&P world, and provide you with the tools to succeed in your job. BP has so many different producing areas in their portfolio that you gain a wide range of skills over a very short time frame.
";"Very large company so things move very slowly. It takes a long time to accomplish anything and that can be frustrating at times. If you do work at BP make sure you are proactive in everything you do, from your technical training to your work... otherwise you can become a number and that does you no good.

463;BP;2014-02-25;Reservoir Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Amazing Opportunity;"Interned twice at BP, went full time. Now working elsewhere.

Big projects, big money, big opportunities. Just incredible. I never met a single jerk at BP. People were willing to put down their work and help you so often. Great gym, great campus, just awesome.
";"The only con is that the HR department drags their legs on everything. They make promises they won't keep, but that's honestly pretty common at Fortune 500s. DO NOT LET THESE CLOWNS KEEP YOU AWAY FROM THIS AMAZING COMPANY!

";"Unfortuatly, the amenities can not over shadow the low moral and poor atmoshpere that soon became a part of the company with the change of management and roles of those within the U.S. Communications Team and C&EA group. It felt more like a high school popularity contest than work. Unfortunately, the latter treatment is what has left a very bad taste in my mouth for this company and especially for the U.S. Communications team.

";"-You're away from home more than half the year when you factor in travel time -BP does not cover flights from your home city to Anchorage (though the flight from Anchorage to Prudhoe Bay is covered), so you're stuck paying for that out of pocket, meaning your actual salary drops significantly once that's factored in -BP is extremely unorganized, and as a company, has no idea on how to run an effective business -Management is kind of a joke -Lots of ""busy work"" which serves no real purpose -Salaries are not reviewed annually, as they should be

";"Constant changes / restructures, lack of competent leaders (especially in IT&S), no ""teeth"" in policies means due process is often ignored with no penalty for the perpetrators, lack of structure in financial authorities / accountabilities.

";"Company outlook is clouded after oil spill. Low oil price is another blow to the company. Company sold a lot of assets and there are limited things to do. In some areas very limited project to work on or even no new project coming in. That is why a lot of good people chose to leave --- the future is very uncertain for the company.

";"-line of sight to promotions are not often transparent -formal learning courses offered are sub-par -bonus structure is not motivating as it is largely determined by the success of the company as a whole and is difficult to affect as an individual - as with many large companies, there is a lot of process that can get in the way of getting work done
"
472;BP;2015-02-26;;Current Employee;My experience is that BP is overall a good company to work for.;"Good benefits (401k with company matching up to 6%), pension, insurance, educational assistance, training, etc. Some groups have 9/80 work schedule and others may allow for other flexible working schedules.
";"As is with large global corporations, there is so much bureaucracy to get things done. Due to inner politics, management sometimes dictate whether a project will ""succeed"" regardless of what that state of ""success"" may look like.
"
473;BP;2008-06-12;Site Manager;Current Employee;Working wonders at BP;"Diversified work force - independence of taking decisions, satisfaction of achievement. It takes time, but eventually you are recognized for your efforts.
";"Too much process to follow. Not enough time given to master one process before moving on to the next one. restriction of employee hours you can use to run sites. Sometimes promises made are not followed through or kept up with. Wage base of hourly at site employees not at par with competitors in the similar field.
"
474;BP;2015-06-26;Cashier;Former Employee;Wonderful town to work in, occasionally frustrating company;"As a cashier at this BP convenience store for nearly 7 years, it was a pleasure to meet so many people in a small town with a very welcoming community. The job was enjoyable and a great way to start my working career in high school. Started at minimum wage and, within 3 years, I reached the hourly rate cap for cashiers. Hours are incredibly flexible and the manager really wants you to be successful, considering this is the first job for some high school students in the area.
";"Although the job isn't physically exhausting, it can be mentally taxing. As with most customer service jobs, some customers can get frustrated easily and may not have patience for a new employee or during a ""rush"" hour. The register technology at this location is almost 20 years old and, admittedly, has been falling apart over the last year. This problem has caused long closures and many headaches for the management and other employees. Hopefully, the company will soon replace the registers with a more up-to-date system.

Management is by quarter; this means necessary long-term expenditures (read maintenance, inspection, etc.) may be deferred. Focus on personal safety with ignorance about process safety Wonderful, people-oriented American managers have been replaced with uncaring Brits Do not seek employment here if you are female or a minority - you will not receive respect or opportunities Say no and you will be asked to leave; it is viewed as disrespecting authority; even politically correct questioning may lead to consequences

";"VERY political company, minimal respect for experienced employees joining the company, often times promotions or Senior Level Leader jobs (Level F and above) are only given to people who ""know"" the management team or who are telling the management team what they want to hear. Very British-centric for adopting ideas and valuing opinions. Americans on global teams are treated with an inferior positioning to their British colleagues. If you can accept this environment then BP is a good fit. Company is downsizing considerably due to the legal problems of the Macondo spill. Basically going to a skeleton work model for the US locations. In financial hardships right now.

Mirred in 'old school' operations beliefs from those who have been with the company since the amoco/ Sohio days, and believe their way is still the best way. Multiple reorganizations, about every two years. Not enough consistency in leadership staying around for mopre than a couple years in role.

";"I really haven't had any negative experiences personally while working here, but I've heard from my colleagues who've been at BP for a long time that things used to be even better before the oil prices tanked.

It's always about people first and production second. I'm proud to work here. I always feel supported by management and my opinions are valued.
";"Since BP is divesting it's southern California operations and we don't know who will buy the refinery, times are uncertain. Right now, we are all in a holding pattern. many things will likely change with new ownership, which is expected by the end of 2012.
"
487;BP;2010-10-12;Senior Geologist;Current Employee;Very big, pretty good, under appreciated exploration staff;"BP has a top notch portfolio with one of the best records of reserves replacment. Training is excellent and consideration for flexibility in life issues is above average. The wild-cat wells are often genuinly wild-cats.
";"I think technical staff are somewhat under appreciated in that there's a strong push to reduce promotions so as not to outpace grades in downstream such as running a bunch of gas stations. It's also getting more difficult to accomplish task with increasing process to control the range of ways of doing things. This is good and bad. BP drills very few exploration wells per year (10 wildcats).
"
488;BP;2015-01-25;Facilities Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Slow / bloated;"BP promotes minorities and women and has a lot of collective knowledge. People are nice at BP, but only because their jobs are ultimately too cushy. It's easy to be nice when you're jobs are fluff and you make fewer executive decisions per person.
";"Everything happens too slowly, too many processes, too much overhead, too many meetings and trying to follow the functional model just because its a corporate trend when you've become a small operator who's overstaffed is not effective.
"
489;BP;2015-07-23;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Great Company;"BP is a great company to work with. Most boss was the greatest and he was very kind and helpful. They took me out to dinner when a was relocating from Ilinois.
";"If i could i would have worked in the day time that would have been better. I would loved to have worked more hours but that would not have been good for my health. Overall great company to work for.
"
490;BP;2016-04-27;Engineer;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Great compensation & benefits, limited professional options;"BP, like many oil majors, has a very generous compensation and benefits package. Salaries are very high compared to service companies, with bonuses when commodity prices are high. Office physical environment is very nice (Fortune 100), and this large company has a large employee base from which one can learn from.
";"Politics and lack of career opportunities given current and past legal problems. Internally, the company is fractious and management undisciplined. Specifically, many company rules are followed/voided by simple fiat. Lack of management accountability has led to overemphasis on short-term gains above all else.
"
491;BP;2009-04-28;Commercial Analyst;Current Employee;There are plusses and minuses to working at BP.;"BP has some great strategic thinkers who will keep the business a competitive supermajor for a long time. In general, it makes good decisions on a global scale, and has some of the best technology in the industry. It allows for flexible work hours and it truly does try to provide for a balance between personal and work life.
";"There are the management elites, and then there are the grunts. Shoving long-time employees into cubicles where there is not enough space to effectively work was just plain stupid. The company spends a huge amount of effort on ""Diversity and Inclusion"", which is fine if you think the work environment has anything to do with ""coming out of the closet"", but everybody except the white male is celebrated. It gets old.

";"- Management style is very 1900's. It is very hierarchical. It was the first and only place where I heard a statement like - ""When you talk to someone at my level"" - Managers are not well trained. They are trained in BP procedures, not how to lead people - Communication to employees is awful. - There is a false focus on safety. At every meeting there was a ""safety moment"", but it was almost used as a way to avoid dealing with real issues
"
494;BP;2009-02-25;Instrument and Controls Technician;Current Employee;For what it is, pretty good. Needs some improvement, but who doesn't?;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks. I appreciate the fact that even if they are truly at heart an oil company, they are taking steps to create a greener company. Overall, I am pretty happy with the company, for what it is and what industry it is in.
";"It is a big company so they have some trouble with change. You have to really work to get anyone to follow recommendations or listen to advice, but it can be done. More so than many places this one has lots of chiefs, lots of initiatives, lots of programs, and all these lead to lots of paperwork. The hire in process leaves a lot to be desired. There are many programs that the only way you find out about them is by asking your coworkers, and that is what HR expects. Sometimes it seems that the extraneous programs and initiatives are more important to management than being good at your job. The politically correct speech and business politics have taken hold of BP and sometimes you long for the “good ole days” when you could say what you mean and mean what you say. It seems that it is all about CYA (cover you’re a**), there are the expected politics and ole boy club that characterizes the oil field. Sometimes common sense takes a back seat to London or Houston’s whims. Not that they are all bad but sometimes they seem overblown, over engineered, and under thought. Sometimes the company doesn’t have the time or money to do things right the first time, but we will have it either on the second or third time though. ? I have never known any other schedule but I work offshore and my schedule is 14 days on 14 days off and 12 hour days for the 14 days that I am at work, I think that I would like to try something else. Not BP’s fault, but it is one negative about the job for me.

";"Incompetent leadership within supply chain Promotion is based on ""who you know NOT what you know"" Supply Chain is one grade above premitive Poor planning and poor execution It is worse than congress when it comes to working together and executing plans Hiring people, warm boddies, just to fill positions Unfair pay practiices even within people within the same grade level

Definitely one of the best (if not the best) company I worked for in terms of taking care of employees. I am not sure there is anything else a company can do to take better care of people. There is constant concern about how people feel and a desire to keep people motivated.
";"A bit too process heavy and there is a lack of people willing to take accountability and ownership. I just wish this changes.
"
497;BP;2017-05-24;Mechanical Engineer;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Good company to work for, with notable caveats;"Working at a refinery is never going to be a typical/relaxing 8-5 gig, but generally speaking, the work-life balance is rather good. Overall compensation is relatively on par with industry competitors.
";"Not the most popular company or industry to work in at the moment. The work-life balance I espoused in the section above is sometimes thrown out of wack. It also seems like our individual site goes through a re-organization every 3-5 years, which creates more hassle and work than anything else.
"
498;BP;2009-07-06;Facilities Engineer;Current Employee;Many opportunities;"There are a large number of opportunities available to employees all over the globe. Because of these opportunities you have the ability to really pick your own career path and this means there is a career path available for all different types of people.
";"The organization is at times overwhelming and is not always focused on supporting operations as well as it should. Different parts of the organization seem to work against each other.
"
499;BP;2015-03-18;;Current Employee;Not the most excellent company;"A person early in their career may do well to exploit BP's passion for hiring them as relatively cheap labor. They could jump ship in a few or if they want to be a bureaucrat they could be happy staying. There can be work-life balance in some areas, and there are a few pockets of interesting work.
";"It is uninspiring and bureaucratic. Good things happen reluctantly. There is no investment, growth or innovation in people or processes. Impossible for serious people to reach their potential. Hollow rhetoric abounds. There was a widely held internal opinion that no company was more excellent than BP and amazingly managers are still acting like they believe that.

";"Mid-level management is too busy trying to seem relative in order to save their jobs during all of the L48 reorganization process. They will even derail careers in order to achieve their own personal goals. Although, I've been gone for over a year the VPs of the L48 assets ARE irrelevant and too busy micromanaging instead of actually doing something worthwhile.

";"Sometimes hard for a clear decision to be made and/or communicated. Tries to learn from past major incidents but not always successful. Company has sold assets and has shrunk in size due to past incidents and low cost of oil.

504;BP;2011-09-14;PSCM Intern;Current Employee;Great place to Intern!;"The PSCM function at BP is growing rapidly, the on the job opportunities and learning were abundant. They treat the interns to paid housing, very competitive pay, and relocation reimbursement. BP also made strong efforts to extend business travel opportunities to interns for extended and enhanced job learning.
";"Some see the new-hire Challenger program having a con in its 2, 1.5 year rotations that demand you spend 1 rotation at a field location that generally speaking is not a desirable place to spend 18 months of your younger years.

505;BP;2012-10-19;Executive;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Former Retail Executive;"BP allows for its interns, employees that are hungry for advancement to take part in projects that have a large impact to the company's performance. They provide opportunity for travel, training, life time mentors, performance awards up to Global Helios including networking with thousands of employees and suppliers. Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey. In a sense, you may look back every now and then and say; “You don’t know what want till it’s gone”. I feel the lucky full time BP employees may have the last of good jobs/careers left in U.S.A.
";"Looking back in this job market. Not too many.

";"Company has local rules governed by local HR.. Very unclear and poor local HR. No definite rules/handbook to follow. 1800 HR (BPpeople) support line is useless. Relative expensive healthcare plan and very few PTO days for industry standard. Managers do not care about employees' feedback. Poor mid and upper level management on local site. Spend excessive amount of time on trainings regarding BP core values. Encourage ""open doors"" culture but not true at all.... Tolerate employees with poor performance and do not reward high performance employees. Do not fairly promote employees.

A lot of new people being brought in from other energy companies -- lots pof growth opportunities.
";"With growth changes across the company, process improvements are likely to take a few years to see the benefits. Leadership program needs to stress accountabilities at all levels. Talent retention will be challenging.

";"Not enough responsibilities and job exposure in the first year of work. You will feel as if you are stifling with boredom. If you are actually interested in becoming a technical expert in your field, think again. Should start with 3 weeks vacation.
"
519;BP;2015-02-11;Safety;Current Employee;Great place to work , but shrinking/sinking ship on the downstream side.;"BP employs some very smart people. The culture is laid back with plenty of flexible working arrangements available. There are some great people that try to work common objectives.
";"The company is risk adverse. After the Texas City and Gulf disasters, there is no appetite to operate assets due to risk exposure. The downstream business is little more than a shell of what it used to be. The company's downsized structure means there really aren't any opportunities to grow. All downstream businesses are restructuring with substantial layoffs ahead for 2015. The company will most likely divest and exit the downstream business when the dust clears.
"

They have lots of benefits that exceed the standard level of benefits in the US. They are a flexible workplace. Seem to be more liberal than a lot of other companies in the industry.
";"While I very much respect and approve of the executive-level leaders of the company, I've had experience with poor management on the lower team lead/manager levels. Myself and many other colleagues are not necessarily happy in their roles. I'm not sure if it's the stress level or the environment, but there can be quite a bit of unrest. Very slow progression up the career ladder. Poor training for more junior employees since classes were cut from the budget.
"
524;BP;2016-08-04;Senior Financial Analyst;Former Employee;BP Company Review;"Great overall salary/compensation package. Good work/life balance. Friendly atmosphere. Convenient location off I-10 in the energy corridor. Good place to work at when the oil price is decent.
";"Not a lot of opportunity for upward mobility. Ever increasing outsourcing of work/services outside of the US. With oil prices being low for an extended period of time, the company has undergone waves of cost cutting and layoffs.
"
525;BP;2015-09-25;Safety Advisor;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Overall Company Review;"The best reason to work at BP is the people. The company is very diverse and has a good development program for its employees.

"
526;BP;2016-04-07;Offshore Planner;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Offshore Planner;"Great benefits and reasonable salaries. Worked with some good people over the years and are as close as family. The work environment outside Houston was genuine.
";"Younger management in key roles with no management or people experience. BP used to be a mature company with great values but has given way to inexperience and management tactics that now discourage speaking up and sharing concerns. If you're not in agreement with management, you're potentially a target for termination. Strongly considering my future with this company. The falling price of oil has really shown me BP's true colors. Not a pretty sight.
"
527;BP;2015-03-06;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Hang on if you can;"Geologists and engineers are valued. Usually relaxed working conditions. Great gyms on campus and next to running trails.

"
533;BP;2008-06-11;FBC;Current Employee;BP Good at Acquisaitions and Terrible at Operations;"It is a place holder job. Since they took over Amoco and ARCO they have taken on the philosophy of burning through employees and then discarding them - just like Pepsi in the 1990's.

Good internship program. Very rigorous and good development program for graduates. Excellent work life balance. Highly competitive work amongst co-workers yet the working culture takes the stress out.
";"Uncompetitive bonus against other companies in the industry. Perhaps this is due to its uncertain financials resulting from the spill. Poor knowledge management system. Finding information is like looking for a needle in a haystack unless you are used to it. Process process process...it is highly complex and can stress someone out. It's complex process can become its own downfall. Not an encouraging company for mid level employees, too much emphasis on graduates and interns.

The Carson plant had a lot of great people and strong culture left over from the ARCO days.

Salary and bonus compensation is competitive and in line with market. 9-80 schedule is a huge perk. Work life balance is good, but will vary depending on your role. There was a focus on personal career development when oil prices were high, but the focus on that has lightened in the recent oil price environment.
";"It can be a frustrating place to work if you care about doing meaningful work and impacting the bottom line. The company is riddled with workflow complexity, tons of process, and indecisive middle management.

";"Very demanding organization. You get out of it what you put in. BP demands a lot from their employees overall and is not a family oriented type of atmosphere if you're into that sort of thing. Sometimes they seem to hire a lot of young and less experienced individuals and I have had to spent countless amounts of time training them. Not enough experience in the workplace.

Very collaborative, diverse and inclusive environment. Lots of smart people. Good work-life balance. Fairly easy to move to other parts of the company.
";"Nearly all researchers across the company were laid off in 2015. This is the second time the company has taken such a U-turn on R&D. After a decade of frivolous spending on renewable energy, the company abandoned the effort completely. There is a top-down change in strategy every few years which leads to a lot of wasted effort. The company has a serious identity crisis. In the past the company could tolerate this waste and a huge overhead because of low oil prices and few competitors. Today the national oil companies (e.g. Aramco, Petrobras) and smaller leaner companies are pretty much up to speed on oil exploration and refining. Without research and development, BP has very little to bring to the table going forward. The layoffs have also created an hourglass demography with a lot of well-connected old men and some new graduates, but very few experienced young people. With such a demographic there is very little organic change and continuous improvement - which may explain why there is a top-down reorg every few years. These reorgs always push out the middle demographic which perpetuates the problem.

I reported them to HR with little to no response. If you are a woman or other minority, then you are more likely to advance in the company. During 2015, when BP was cutting over 20% of their people, I over heard HR telling someone on the phone that they could NOT let any women go. You must watch your back while working at BP because the managers will throw you under the bus. Important note: I wasn't laid off by BP.

Business Outlook
Pros
BP is an excellent place to work. Corporate values include safety, diversity, excellence, courage, and ""one team"", and every employee or contractor I have worked with adheres to these values and speaks up whenever they notice behaviors that don't reflect corporate values. I have never had a more satisfying work experience. During layoff periods, employees and contractors are given plenty of advance notice and encouraged to actively seek other employment.
Cons
Contractors often are not invited to town hall meetings, especially during the recent layoff periods. As a contractor, I had to rely on others to share what was discussed in town halls.

Access to child development center/ daycare on site and at a discounted price for employees. Two well equipped gyms with new equipment and staffed with personal trainers. Overtime available to some positions. Great Diversity and Inclusion program and a very inclusive culture.
";"Due to the slump in oil prices this company has really passed along the pinch to its employees. Upper management is taking away the prized ""work life balance"" structure. and removing the option to work on 9/80 schedules. No more private offices, cramming the occupants of 2-3 buildings into 1 building and requiring everyone to be at work everyday instead of flex scheduling. Changing all offices to open concept. They took away all land lines and office telephones, all communications have moved to Skype only. Management has cut down on office perks and benefits. Janitorial services cut down. Charitable donations cut. Cafeteria food is expensive and terrible. No clear communication from management to their subordinates. No room for career growth. Personal development plans and bonuses are not based on individual performance and are not in control of your manager but based on group level performance. A lot of lay offs and cut backs and not much hope for the remaining employees. Very low morale.

Salaries are very high compared to service companies, with bonuses when commodity prices are high. Office physical environment is very nice (Fortune 100), and this large company has a large employee base from which one can learn from.
";"Politics and lack of career opportunities given current and past legal problems. Internally, the company is fractious and management undisciplined.

";"Younger management in key roles with no management or people experience. BP used to be a mature company with great values but has given way to inexperience and management tactics that now discourage speaking up and sharing concerns. If you're not in agreement with management, you're potentially a target for termination. Strongly considering my future with this company.

";"Management is by and large incompetent (starting at the very top and trickling down to those who have to interact with the lowly plebes who actually do work) and reached their lofty positions by delivering good sales pitches as opposed to producing quality results, showing sound leadership, and having any form of business acumen. This is taken out on individual contributors who suffer the consequences of the downturn. Individual contributors who achieve and those who are recognized for achievement are not significantly overlapping in a Venn Diagram.

";"BP is a poorly managed company, their safety track record speaks for itself. Though they advertise that they are focused on improving, leadership has done little to change the culture. They've been in constant ""transformation"" for the last 5-8 years. Also just recently, at least in the US they have been making it more challenging to participate in agile working arrangements. Leadership has not eliminated agile working, they have just communicated a message that does not promote it. Because they pay well senior managers tend not to leave, and most are waiting for a severance package to do so. This leads to very little long term opportunity.

If you are wanting a career at BP, start at big BP (benefits and pay are much better), rather than BP's Shared Business Services (Global Business Services, GBS).

738;BP;2015-11-02;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Depends what you're looking for;"Now is not a great time in oil & gas generally, and BP is no different than others in that regard. That being said it has the advantage of being large and fully integrated, therefore able to withstand the ups and downs better than many smaller companies. Pay is very good; benefits are generally good (some competitors do a better job in 401k). There are lots of quality folks here, and - again, because of sheer size - lots of potential opportunity to gain experience.
";"A large organization can be both a plus and minus. The other side of the breadth of opportunity it the breadth and dept of bureaucracy - as one former colleague described it: ""it's like working for the federal government, only it pays better""! There remains something of a split culture - heritage Amoco vs heritage BP (and to a much lesser extent Arco and Sohio) - and it seems (subjectively) that most heritage Amoco leaders are more people-focused than their heritage BP counterparts. If you are in a corporate staff function, Houston seems on its way to becoming a ""regional office"" with the balance of power (and breadth of opportunity) solidly in the UK. And it is

747;BP;2015-11-05;Director;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Concensus paralysis;"BP pays well above market, which is great while you are there. It may haunt you in future job searches. Upstream BP is very good at what they do, finding energy. IT is weak and misguided but that provides opportunity for smart people to do great work. There are some great people at BP, diamonds in the rough, who can make it a great company someday if they can effect change on the culture.
";"BP management pays lip service to modern corporate values but fails to change. There are so many levels of management, most of which are clueless to what other great companies are doing and yet are closed to new ideas. Powerful internal customers routinely overrule subject matter experts to get their own way. BP calls itself collaborative but the reality is a paradox where consensus is required but everyone wants their own way effectively paralyzing any meaningful change. London lives with it's head in the clouds effectively ignoring the wants and needs to employees and leaders worldwide. Ex. 9am (GMT) global con calls are 3 am US Central time...when pressed the UK leaders will respond that the meeting can be recorded and reviewed later. Happens all the time. BP wastes more money than most companies make, which has got to be hard with the price of oil so low these days.

I have met some very good people at this company. That's about the only good thing I have to say about this place--that, and the pay is decent.
";"Micromanaging, soul-sucking, and discriminatory are a few words that come to mind. I was disciplined and later fired for ""attendance issues"" because I was having to go to the bathroom frequently while pregnant (despite having a doctor's note, they still disciplined me). Also, working from home after my child was born caused me to get disciplined because the computer wouldn't log into the VPN on time half the time. Computers would take upwards of 15 minutes to log in but you would be punished for not being on the phone exactly on your start time. Sometimes the computers would take 20 minutes to log in, and you would still get disciplined when it was out of your control. You shouldn't have to arrive 30 minutes early just because your computer is slow. You are only allowed 10 minutes for the bathroom in any given day, and trust me, they watch that time. It doesn't matter if you're sick or not, 10 minutes is all you get. The managers need to know your every word and action and you're not allowed to help the customer in any way outside of predefined solutions. Your hands are tied and every move watched at this company. To top it off, the team leads are often less competent than your coworkers, and they will question your judgement.

810;BP;2015-06-26;Cashier;Former Employee;Wonderful town to work in, occasionally frustrating company;"As a cashier at this BP convenience store for nearly 7 years, it was a pleasure to meet so many people in a small town with a very welcoming community. The job was enjoyable and a great way to start my working career in high school. Started at minimum wage and, within 3 years, I reached the hourly rate cap for cashiers. Hours are incredibly flexible and the manager really wants you to be successful, considering this is the first job for some high school students in the area.
";"Although the job isn't physically exhausting, it can be mentally taxing. As with most customer service jobs, some customers can get frustrated easily and may not have patience for a new employee or during a ""rush"" hour. The register technology at this location is almost 20 years old and, admittedly, has been falling apart over the last year. This problem has caused long closures and many headaches for the management and other employees. Hopefully, the company will soon replace the registers with a more up-to-date system.

Company is great when it comes to family or medical emergencies. No thanks to management, I think HR probably forces managers to behave like decent human beings on most occasions. Company has clearly done a lot to promote women in the workplace over the last few years. Quite entertaining meetings where you'll see and hear what must be some of the most incompetent, try-hard people on the planet spew a lifetime supply of buzzwords and navigate through the endless wilderness of BP corporate processes and re-organization. Much like living in an episode of 'The Office'.
";"Sickening to see just how much money is wasted. They may as well be lighting piles of money on fire around here. Even with strides made towards promoting women, nepotism and good ol' boy system is alive and well. Hiring and promoting other minorities has clearly fallen short. The only real reason to come to work is the pay. Spineless, boot-lick middle managers report to type-A bullies. Even the simplest decisions get passed up to the second line and VP positions. Pretty sure you need to murder someone before you get fired. Seriously. Incompetent people get passed around group to group (sometimes even promoted) for years. Showing up for work, doing your job and trying to protect the business is often under appreciated. If you really want to go places with this company, be prepared to cultivate personal friendships with managers. Company coddles new engineers, the 'challenge' program is a joke. Process, process, process. BP has a sick obsession with paperwork, checklists, creating do-nothing middle management positions and other non-revenue earning paper pushers. The company is like a wounded animal slowly bleeding out after Macondo. They don't seem to understand there is no reward unless you take risk.

";"Cost-cutting to the point of foolishness.. e.g. getting rid of the ""good"" coffee and leaving the bad.. for a whopping savings of $.25 cents a cup??!! Many layoffs currently (2014 & 2015) in the guise of another ""reorg"" but it's really TONS of offshoring happening to KL, Budapest, BA, Bangalore, etc. Just transferring bad systems & processes to another country.. costs will rise there also and the savings will hence be only short-lived! Not that this matters any to current management.. they will earn their bonus and move on to their next executive role! Reorg's to fix the botched reorg's of the past.. this will continue until the end of time for BP, as management considers that all intelligence lies in the UK so it HEAVILY promotes Brits to Sr. roles (VP's, Directors, etc.). They need to stay busy & build their resume for their next role so every few years it's ""reorg's all-around for everyone at the bar""! If you can tolerate that then the benefits can outweigh the pain.. meanwhile I hope you can find time to do you day job and actually enjoy contributing.. trying to make it a meaningful job/career.. otherwise it's just a paycheck.. good luck!

";"Management slow to make decisions. BP tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The powers to be make costly and sometimes ill advised decisions in order to appease the safety board. The COW program (control of work) is ineffective, out of control, and should be abolished or simplified. More paper, forms, and meetings do not make you work safer or smarter! Also, BP has too many levels of management and so many made up titles. With this culture, nobody can make a decision without checking with multi parties involved...... Frustrating sometimes!

";"They are a bit more old-school. There are definitely some 'gotchas' in their culture indicative that they don't have a full theory of the relationship between employee and employer. There are also rather rigid evaluation and promotion practices that seemed detriment. And there are definitely people there counting down the days until retirement, even people in their 30s. They also don't do a very good job of empowering employees. They are afraid of developing single points of failure and will intentionally limit what you are working on.

";"It is uninspiring and bureaucratic. Good things happen reluctantly. There is no investment, growth or innovation in people or processes. Impossible for serious people to reach their potential.

Talent isn't what gets you promoted. They try to control people by saying ""It's not what you do but how you do it"". That's BS as this is an oil company and ""what we do"" keeps things from blowing up and killing people. They promote for behaviors not how you impact the business or how good your delivery is.

";"The company is risk adverse. After the Texas City and Gulf disasters, there is no appetite to operate assets due to risk exposure. The downstream business is little more than a shell of what it used to be. The company's downsized structure means there really aren't any opportunities to grow.

";"College graduates may find an eventual glass ceiling if looking for the management track. Many college recruits tend to leave BP after 7 to 10 years because they find BP tends to have an age bias when promoting staff to the next level of management.

BP management listened to us Senior staff members and let us do whatever we needed and however we wanted if we could show it would reduce risk and/or lower operational cost. They insisted we maintain a good work life balance so if we had to pull long weekends or evenings as DBAs often do they insisted on giving us comp time on other days. I never once worked more than 80 hours during a 2 week period in my 30 months there. They let us bring on staff in India who could do most work during off hours for us which helped the work life balance even more. Pay was very good.
";"The only real con was suffering from fallout of the Gulf Oil Spill. The reason I'm not there now is budget cuts due to having to pay for that. This was tied as the best place I've ever worked and I'd gladly go back to that team again if the compensation package was similar to last time.

";"Since the Horizon disaster, I have not met anyone who now likes working for BP. Headcount cuts are too deep. Significant brain drain. The happiest employees seem to be the ones getting severance packages. Company continues to bleed cash at unsustainable levels. Drastic headcount, cost, and asset reductions while competitors are growing. Consensus culture inhibits qualified decision-making. Experts not listened to. Tons of processes that are rarely followed, especially HSE and quality. (Most is just market-facing window dressing developed by consultants.) Changing the portfolio strategy to ultra-deep water is a very long term and highly risky decision. It may make the traders happy for a while, but if the ROI is not big or fast enough, it's not a horse to bet on. Job positions are safer in Europe than in North America. Lots of talk of all or part of North America being sold, bankrupted, or shut down.

While there is so much talk about meritocracy, nepotism, cronyism are the order of the day. Promotions and career progression are based on color of skin, whether you have parent(s) that work(ed) for the company, whose behind you are kissing and how much you can BS. Little wonder Macondo happened!!! Over-reliance on a performance management system that isn't transparent and lacks any oversight or checks and balances by upper management.

1008;BP;2013-10-07;Team Leader;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Not the company it once was;"BP is a large company, and tries to be one with good values. In the past BP was a company where a strong meritocracy culture prevailed. However, its strength was its weakness, which means a lack of strong business processes allowed for employee room to create as you figured things out. Some would argue this is why we had so many industrial accidents.
";"Following Macondo, it has become more of ""do the right thing for BP"" instead of ""do the right thing"" -- its a subtle but important change. Combine this with weak business processes, and you can imagine the slippery slope when less scrupulous managers acquire power. This is important to understand if you are thinking of entering an employment relationship with BP.

The people generally are very bright.
";"You probably will be doing the work of people at other companies that get paid a lot more than you. So you'll get high pay, but you'll be doing 2 jobs at least with one of those being little different than the next pay grade higher. That means you can be worked to death at times - not enough time to do both jobs in a day.

63;DTE;2021-02-07;Individual Contributor;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Career death trap for people of color. No upward mobility here!;"Good benefits, and worklife balance. Cares about employee safety and well being. Company has done an excellent job supporting employees and their families with work from home efforts during the pandemic. The company has really shown itself as a ""Force For Growth in the Community"" as quoted in the company's statement. This is probably the one thing that makes me proud to work here.
";"Company lacks minorities and women in leadership and will go out of their way not to promote minorities from within. I wouldn't recommend anyone who looks like me to come here. While the package to get you in the door may look impressive and promising; your opportunities for advancement are not. On average, a person of color remains in the same job they hired into the company 5 to 10 years later while white counter parts experience 1-2 promotions within that same time span. This company will promote a white person without proper qualifications in a heartbeat, but will pick apart the qualifications of a person of color and find reasons not to promote them. It's truly sad that you can ask any random employee of color (especially black employees) about their career experience and they all have similar stories. In some departments this place is run like a modern day plantation. Dont waste your time complaining about it. The HR, Ethics and Legal departments turn a side eye to everything and you will definitely be retaliated against for speaking up about an issue.
Advice to Management
I'm not sure what to think about the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives the company has now adapted. Right now there is a lot of work going on to promote an inclusive culture. While I am appreciative of these steps- the company has a long way to go. In my opinion the company is still doing a lot of talking the talk but not walking the walk in terms of promotions. The company does a great job hiring minorities but not promoting them. My advice would be to promote minorities from within and stop making them work 10 times harder for opportunities. It's a disgusting practice (rather intentional or unintentional) that really needs to stop.

";"The culture at DTE is setup so that only white males are allowed to have upward mobility. Minorities (Black, Asian, Hispanic, & Middle-Eastern) should avoid applying here as your career will be held back and your promotional oppurtunties will be limited. 

Your white managers and supervisors will also pick on you just to humiliate you by nit-picking on every little issue and use that as an excuse to pass you up on promotions while the white guys get promoted just for showing up. Its hard to believe that a company based in Detroit will actively discriminate against minorities in such a brutal fashion.

";"Benefits for non-union employees are expensive. Management level employees not concerned with the development of the workers reporting to them as most I have worked with are trying to justify their existence within the company.

Company talking points always changing, lots of flavors of the month programs that do not amount to much.

If possible, provide students with the option to use Windows laptops owned by DTE.

";"Nuclear generation is poor performer with respect to industry and not getting significantly better. Night and weekends are typical every week due to some unforeseen equipment or paperwork issue. They say it's getting better but it really isn't. They are burying things that will continue to haunt them for many years to come.

Nuclear senior management is easily the worst I've worked for. Only care about production, NOT people or their work life balance.

HR is silent and letting directors/VP run the place out of control.

401k is pathetic - you have to VEST before you get a dime from the company (greater than 3 years). They either don't make this available to new hires, or it's buried in the fine print.
Advice to Management
You have extremely poor directors, nearly every single one of them. They push all responsibility and accountability to their direct reports and individual contributors and pretend like they are so busy and overworked. 

Your loosing top notch staff because you wanted ""Followers"" vs the leaders you had. 

You had some of the best subject matter experts in the country but didn't set them up for success. They either resigned, left or transferred.

You turn the blinders on and ignore the more important things (that you don't want to hear or deal with) and go after the easy low hanging fruit instead. Wake up!

185;DTE;2016-06-30;Staff Engineer;Former Employee;DTE Gas Co.: Great Place To Work, Sad to Leave;"DTE uses ""overpaid consultants"" to figure out what makes a company a good place to work, but they actually listen to the recommendations developed. When I was employed there for two years, we had mandatory meetings to discuss improvements in useful areas of employee engagement (with *actual* support from management). We cared about each-other, and were never afraid to ask questions or sound stupid. As an engineer, that always bothers me, but DTE made me feel comfortable with it.
";"These ""cons"" are very petty, I really can't think of much... My department was old-fashioned, they didn't allow telecommuting at all. They only had one kind of coffee for free. Escalation of actual, legitimate problems took longer than I wanted (but always eventually happened) - it was on the order of months, not days (that's what it's like at a utility company though).
Advice to Management
Keep the current CEO, Jerry Anderson - he's setting the company culture and really cares about doing good work and keeping good company morale. The days can get a little stuffy sometimes (because of the open floor-plan people don't really joke around much, as they're afraid to have others overhear) - So try to set the culture individually yourselves, have fun so your people do too.

";"Old fashioned company, the majority of employees have been there for a long time, so they don't know things can be better (benefit package is mediocre), no discount on their services to employees, different departments don't communicate well with each other, low starting pay, my experience left me feeling the company is more interested in their community image and reputation rather than making employees feel valued. I don't feel safe working there. There are many visitors, construction contractors and contracted employees there all the time. I couldn't look at a person and immediately tell they were an employee. Parking isn't very secure. There is a great security presence once inside, but it seemed like I worked in a public place (equivalent to an airport). Too many different unions usually mean problem with management and employee relations. Computer system (CSB) should be retired now!
Advice to Management
Value your employees and your employees will value your customers. Empower frontline employees more. When hiring it would be more beneficial to take advantage of new employee's skills vs. being so rigid with the job description. The opposite occurs when there are unions involved, unfortunately. Considering giving CRs the option of working from home. It would make a better work life balance, especially since there is the use of mandatory overtime. Good luck with the new customer system, because the current one is not very user friendly/efficient. Pay frontline employees appropriately (more), since their job is more important than management's (according to management).

Advice to Management
Try to make it into the 21st century. You can still have a successful company with open communication at all levels -- leaders do not have all of the answers, especially as they get more removed from the actual work. Also allowing more personal involvement in annual goal setting would add meaning to performance appraisals and help drive development discussions.

";"Typical large corporation with bloated bureaucracy and slow-moving parts. The organization is so big, however, that this ironically varies depending on where you are. 

Typical virtue signaling when it comes to the issue of the day instead of a principled corporate culture that is not moved by trending controversies.
Advice to Management
This is certainly not directed at Marathon alone (nearly every big company is similar), but it is scary as an employee to see a company cave into political pressure every time something new comes up since you never know what is coming next in terms of personnel training and virtue signaling, and what may or may not be politically correct on any given day. My advice would be to ignore what's in the news and just focus on running an effective company that serves the world's energy needs.

Little diversity in the company, particularly in the upper ranks. The corporate officers, board, and upper management are largely white and male. Exorbitant pay for upper management and officers. Last year, the company laid off 9% of its workforce despite taking $2.1 billion in federal tax benefits meant to cushion the pandemic’s blow to the economy. At the same time, dividends were awarded to shareholders. Minimal meaningful training was provided past initial on-boarding.

Advice to Management
Learn how to be leaders. Leaders need followers and followers require trust and acts of admiration. Develop your people, so they don't continuously leave. Get rid of your draconian work schedule (5 days x 8 hours) and give your salaried people some flexibility. Allow people who don't want to move some ability to progress in their career. Hire outside of the Marathon family. Look for talent, not relation.

Maintenance department managers show favoritism to employees that truly do not deserve the promotions that were received. I was told for myself when Marathon repurchased the st Paul park refinery by the HR professionals from corporate that I would qualify for the retirement health benefits at the time they purchased the refinery. 2 years later I was laid off due to covid and corporate restructuring. the severance package was good but not I hit the lottery. but 3 weeks before I was supposed to start my retirement health plan I receive a letter stating what I needed to do to enroll in the program. the next week I receive another letter saying that I do not qualify for the retirement health care program????? i called HR and was basically told to bad. I called and tried to explain what I was told at the transition and that I had 25+ years with the company. My advice is if you ever apply for a job there make sure it's part of the union, its is the only way you'll have any job security and you will also get raises.
Advice to Management
The employees do see all of the mishandling of things that take place in the maintenance department. yet nothing changes, people without the knowledge required are advanced due to being able to BS with the senior management. very poor and unprofessional managerial taking place! example of this during the layoff ""due to covid"" there were about 17 people laid off and a majority of these people were over the age of 50 most with 15+ years of service. I really don't have any idea what there selection process was but the positions that were laid off didn't go away they were just reassigned. from what I have seen Marathon has posted job positions that were supposedly no longer needed during the covid period (which is still here).

Today this is not the case. Morale is very low, turnover is near constant, and leadership is silent on the issue.
Advice to Management
Devise a strategy to address the people/culture issue so that we can attract and retain talent. Consider offering some flexibility in work from home policy - having a fully in-office model puts us at a major competitive disadvantage.

Pay your employees fairly. I resigned from my role, and before I was even out the door my role was posted 3 salary grades higher than what I was ($17-63k more).

Marathon is limping along as a company - more concerned about returning money to shareholders than ensuring employees are fairly compensated and developed. Unless you live in Findlay, or are hired in as an entry level engineer, expect to hate your position.

Findlay employees called the cops on multiple Andeavor employees for running outside in the morning.. Their crime? Exercising while black.

Great pay but I think the benefits department could use a little work on it health care plans. We have lots of employees and that gives us leverage during negotiations with insurance companies, but I'm not sure it's idea effectively.
";"Although the folks are lovely, having HQ in Findlay is not sustainable for the long term future of the company.

Unless you're an executive, you're flying in and out of Detroit, which is a huge chore and time waster.

We might see some co-location progress now that the new CDO will be based out of SA.

Also, a big hangup is that IT is constantly prevented from speaking directly to business users when we need answers. We have to go through intermediaries which increases time-to-completion.

There is a lot of talk about diversity, but it is just to satisfy the political correctness and everyone just rolls their eyes. They lay off some of the best employees they've ever had, and keep the lazy if they are in the clique. Safety is a banner word, but in reality it is only a matter of time until the truth is discovered in the public eye in the form of a catastrophic event.
Advice to Management
Quit promoting only the people who pretend and can put on the best show, and start being more aware of who actually cares and knows what they are doing. Playing politics and otherwise treating people bad will eventually catch up to you, and your poor leadership skills will be brought to light.

This company use to be a decent company with stability until about 5 or 6 years ago when they started to grow and put their total focus on making share holders happy, at that point things started to slowly go down hill. Employees are no longer valued. Management positions are given but in a number of cases decisions are not allowed to be made by the people placed in those positions. All decisions seem to be made by a handful of select individuals in each region of operation with little regard to the opinions of others.

There are opportunities to move into different roles every couple of years if that's your career plan.
";"The culture is outdated and needs to be brought up to the 21st century. Much of the leadership is old school and stuck in Findlay for years. Marketing controls too much of the operational side of the business but the leaders don't have commercial experience.
Advice to Management
Communicate more with employees, especially upper management. The quarterly town hall meetings seemed to have stopped under the new leadership.

Advice to Management
Continue growing work/life balance opportunities (alternate schedules, work from home, etc) to attract the most talented new-hires. Ensure that individuals have access to opportunities to grow their careers rather than becoming stagnant in a role.

For starters, stop boasting diversity, when the higher up you go, there is no diversity or attempts to address this. Really need to improve HR, it's like they are there just to show face, does not assist at all. Need to do a better job placing individuals in management/supervisory role, too many in position of power that are not leaders, feel that they know to much rather than to help/promote.

";"Work/life balance is atrocious and work tends to be all-consuming.

Stop focusing so heavily on hiring directly out of colleges and start bringing in outside opinions. Industry is changing too quickly to rely solely on fostering internal ideas. Thinking outside of the box means you need to pull people in from a different box!

";"This company claims they are family friendly. In all reality they are all about money, and in this market, with the andeavor purchase/ debt they are in major cost cutting mode. Since the MPLX failed to bring in the sustainable 10% growth they're looking at selling major assets, and reducing head count. Like most companies, you are just a number, and they will make you feel just that way. Their ""safety focused "".... well it's all about safety until it's about money, then all bets are off . It's a poorly managed, cutthroat business with and awful HR dept, incompetent management, skeleton crews in the field who work their lives away. Marathon was once ranked as the best large company to work for in Forbes, now it continues to free fall as the administration destroys the company from the inside out. If you're looking for a secure company, look elsewhere.
Advice to Management
Stop treating your employees like they're just a number for one. Field management is poor at best. Nobody likes Findlay, nobody.

382;Marathon;2019-10-30;Manager;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Good company but needs to change;"- Good pay, but that’s comparable with the industry. Others might be paying better (such as Philips66)
- Steady business, even with the swings of the market.
- Large company with plenty of opportunities if you are flexible and mobile. National footprint is a plus.
- Pension plan and good benefits
";"- Old School Governance model (processes, systems, behaviors, approvals)
- If you are not in the “click” of the Marathon “lifers” you are not trusted
- There are conflicts of interests at all levels with multiple family members getting jobs without qualifications, but just because their are family.
- HQ in Findlay, OH. Really??? In the middle of nowhere, hard to travel in and out. Small town mentality for the largest refiner in the country.
- Compliance trumps everything, and there are unnecessary systems, controls, audits, etc. to monitor things normally not an issue elsewhere. There will be controls and processes in place to remove accountability of the individuals (expect everyone to be robots).
Advice to Management
Change is needed. You can’t operate the largest refiner in the U.S. like if was done in the 80’s and 90’s. Oil and Gas companies have evolved and modernized, but Marathon seems not to want or accept that times are different

";"Since the merger, many people have left or been pushed out for speaking up on life safety issues or doing the right thing. Policies are changed when management wants a change, not from a top-down direction but more of "" the fix watching the gen house"". This causes lots of problems when people are more focused on cutting costs and making bonus while having an attitude of that will never happen. 

They have recently been routinely putting people on performance reviews to create a false paper trail in order to fire them. Most of these people have previously always received great reviews and the maximum bonus. 
 No longer the great company it was.
Advice to Management
Stop running like a good ole boys club and be committed to your company's values. You need to maintain staff levels to support change and saying people can expect to work twice as hard for less will not help morale.

414;Marathon;2020-01-21;Manager;Current Employee;Great company, but at risk of getting left behind;"It is a company with great people, great pay, and great benefits. There are many opportunities from coast to coast, so you could spend your entire career at one company. 

Despite the stigma that often comes with an O&G company, MPC is truly trying to lead the industry in its environmental sustainability efforts, while remaining pragmatic and realistic about the world's demand for affordable and reliable energy. 

Not withstanding the corporate office in Findlay, MPC offers a great deal of work locations across the country that could fit anyone's desired geographic preference and allows those that desire it, to experience different cultures, climates, and cuisines.
";"The CEO is old fashioned and out of touch. Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. 

The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. 

They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. 

Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. 

In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.
Advice to Management
Move the HQ out of Findlay and step into the 21st century with regards to work practices and work/life balance. Diversify the leadership team.
