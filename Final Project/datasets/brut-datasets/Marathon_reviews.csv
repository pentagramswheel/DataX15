2021-10-20;Senior Project Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Good company with bad culture;"Great pay and benefits compared to US average, but on the low side for Oil & Gas. Enjoyed my team and most people I worked with. There are lots of really great talented people there. Your boss will make or break your experience. Lots of opportunities for advancement and locations all over the county if you're willing to move.
";"The culture is in the gutter. Used to be a great company and I always loved working for them, but as Marathon grew over the years they turned away from the ""family values and employees first"" mentality to very strictly shareholders first and it became evident with management and every single decision made. Upper management is abrasively conservative and responded poorly to the market and employee needs post Covid.

2021-09-20;Advanced Business Analyst;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Good Company;"Coworkers, Benefits, Challenging Work Environment
";"Old world culture, job advancement, employee development. Annual Goals are primarily dictated to the individual which lessens personal engagement. Still very much a ""Command and Control"" environment in some areas. If you try to talk candidly to leadership, you can get chastised for not following proper chain of command.
Advice to Management
Try to make it into the 21st century. You can still have a successful company with open communication at all levels -- leaders do not have all of the answers, especially as they get more removed from the actual work. Also allowing more personal involvement in annual goal setting would add meaning to performance appraisals and help drive development discussions.

2021-06-27;Pipeline Project Engineer;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Very generous and professionally run company;"Lots of training to management and it shows. There is a culture of respect and professionalism in every area of the company. Benefits and pay are generous, typical with the industry. If you are not familiar with oil and gas, you will make more than you will in most industries.
";"Typical large corporation with bloated bureaucracy and slow-moving parts. The organization is so big, however, that this ironically varies depending on where you are. 

Typical virtue signaling when it comes to the issue of the day instead of a principled corporate culture that is not moved by trending controversies.
Advice to Management
This is certainly not directed at Marathon alone (nearly every big company is similar), but it is scary as an employee to see a company cave into political pressure every time something new comes up since you never know what is coming next in terms of personnel training and virtue signaling, and what may or may not be politically correct on any given day. My advice would be to ignore what's in the news and just focus on running an effective company that serves the world's energy needs.

2021-09-09;Anonymous;Former Employee;Not the company it once was;"Competitive pay, including healthcare benefits. Good vacation for experienced employees. Supportive of attempts to move within the company.
";"Very conservative, old-school company. The corporate headquarters is located in Findlay, Ohio, a fairly long commute to larger metropolitan areas. No or minimal work from home was allowed until the COVID-19 pandemic, though employees are back in the office now that the pandemic is perceived as waning. Little diversity in the company, particularly in the upper ranks. The corporate officers, board, and upper management are largely white and male. Exorbitant pay for upper management and officers. Last year, the company laid off 9% of its workforce despite taking $2.1 billion in federal tax benefits meant to cushion the pandemic’s blow to the economy. At the same time, dividends were awarded to shareholders. Minimal meaningful training was provided past initial on-boarding.

";"The nepotism in the company is hard to believe. Most people who get promoted are related to somebody higher up in the company. The company has metrics to hire minorities and discriminates against white males continuously. Marathon people are very arrogant and think Marathon is the best at everything. They cannot provide any type of progression path for employees who aren't in the ""inner circle of nepotism"". They recently had a layoff while concurrently hiring new relatives of employees onsite.
Advice to Management
Learn how to be leaders. Leaders need followers and followers require trust and acts of admiration. Develop your people, so they don't continuously leave. Get rid of your draconian work schedule (5 days x 8 hours) and give your salaried people some flexibility. Allow people who don't want to move some ability to progress in their career. Hire outside of the Marathon family. Look for talent, not relation.

";"forced overtime, Job security (unless in the union), managers talking about employees behind their back. Maintenance department managers show favoritism to employees that truly do not deserve the promotions that were received. I was told for myself when Marathon repurchased the st Paul park refinery by the HR professionals from corporate that I would qualify for the retirement health benefits at the time they purchased the refinery. 2 years later I was laid off due to covid and corporate restructuring. the severance package was good but not I hit the lottery. but 3 weeks before I was supposed to start my retirement health plan I receive a letter stating what I needed to do to enroll in the program. the next week I receive another letter saying that I do not qualify for the retirement health care program????? i called HR and was basically told to bad. I called and tried to explain what I was told at the transition and that I had 25+ years with the company. My advice is if you ever apply for a job there make sure it's part of the union, its is the only way you'll have any job security and you will also get raises.
Advice to Management
The employees do see all of the mishandling of things that take place in the maintenance department. yet nothing changes, people without the knowledge required are advanced due to being able to BS with the senior management. very poor and unprofessional managerial taking place! example of this during the layoff ""due to covid"" there were about 17 people laid off and a majority of these people were over the age of 50 most with 15+ years of service. I really don't have any idea what there selection process was but the positions that were laid off didn't go away they were just reassigned. from what I have seen Marathon has posted job positions that were supposedly no longer needed during the covid period (which is still here).

This is due to the fact that people who drive work no matter the cost are often promoted to supervisor roles.

Pay your employees fairly. I resigned from my role, and before I was even out the door my role was posted 3 salary grades higher than what I was ($17-63k more).

Marathon is limping along as a company - more concerned about returning money to shareholders than ensuring employees are fairly compensated and developed. Unless you live in Findlay, or are hired in as an entry level engineer, expect to hate your position.

Findlay employees called the cops on multiple Andeavor employees for running outside in the morning.. Their crime? Exercising while black.

Great pay but I think the benefits department could use a little work on it health care plans. We have lots of employees and that gives us leverage during negotiations with insurance companies, but I'm not sure it's idea effectively.
";"Although the folks are lovely, having HQ in Findlay is not sustainable for the long term future of the company.

Unless you're an executive, you're flying in and out of Detroit, which is a huge chore and time waster.

We might see some co-location progress now that the new CDO will be based out of SA.

Also, a big hangup is that IT is constantly prevented from speaking directly to business users when we need answers. We have to go through intermediaries which increases time-to-completion.

2020-12-02;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Management is killing the company, including impulsive business deals done in greed;"Very good pay, and very good co-workers (for the most part)
";"There are a few good managers, but for the most part they are just a good ole boy network who play the game and pretend to care about the company while they line their pockets and protect only themselves. There is a lot of talk about diversity, but it is just to satisfy the political correctness and everyone just rolls their eyes. They lay off some of the best employees they've ever had, and keep the lazy if they are in the clique. Safety is a banner word, but in reality it is only a matter of time until the truth is discovered in the public eye in the form of a catastrophic event.
Advice to Management
Quit promoting only the people who pretend and can put on the best show, and start being more aware of who actually cares and knows what they are doing. Playing politics and otherwise treating people bad will eventually catch up to you, and your poor leadership skills will be brought to light.

Age discrimination is running rampant don't plan to retire at this company it's ok to start and learn here but I would plan to move on in your early 40's to avoid any age discrimination issues or unemployment later on in life. This company use to be a decent company with stability until about 5 or 6 years ago when they started to grow and put their total focus on making share holders happy, at that point things started to slowly go down hill. Employees are no longer valued. Management positions are given but in a number of cases decisions are not allowed to be made by the people placed in those positions. All decisions seem to be made by a handful of select individuals in each region of operation with little regard to the opinions of others.

Advice to Management
Continue growing work/life balance opportunities (alternate schedules, work from home, etc) to attract the most talented new-hires. Ensure that individuals have access to opportunities to grow their careers rather than becoming stagnant in a role. Don't let the short-term challenge of the pandemic compromise the long-term success of the organization.

";"Work/life balance is atrocious and work tends to be all-consuming.

Too many people in upper, senior and executive leadership have been with the company for their entire careers.

Stop focusing so heavily on hiring directly out of colleges and start bringing in outside opinions. Industry is changing too quickly to rely solely on fostering internal ideas. Thinking outside of the box means you need to pull people in from a different box!

";"This company claims they are family friendly. In all reality they are all about money, and in this market, with the andeavor purchase/ debt they are in major cost cutting mode. Since the MPLX failed to bring in the sustainable 10% growth they're looking at selling major assets, and reducing head count. Like most companies, you are just a number, and they will make you feel just that way. Their ""safety focused "".... well it's all about safety until it's about money, then all bets are off . It's a poorly managed, cutthroat business with and awful HR dept, incompetent management, skeleton crews in the field who work their lives away. Marathon was once ranked as the best large company to work for in Forbes, now it continues to free fall as the administration destroys the company from the inside out. If you're looking for a secure company, look elsewhere.

Stop treating your employees like they're just a number for one. Field management is poor at best. Nobody likes Findlay, nobody.

2019-10-30;Manager;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Good company but needs to change;"- Good pay, but that’s comparable with the industry. Others might be paying better (such as Philips66)
- Steady business, even with the swings of the market.
- Large company with plenty of opportunities if you are flexible and mobile. National footprint is a plus.
- Pension plan and good benefits
";"- Old School Governance model (processes, systems, behaviors, approvals)
- If you are not in the “click” of the Marathon “lifers” you are not trusted
- There are conflicts of interests at all levels with multiple family members getting jobs without qualifications, but just because their are family.
- HQ in Findlay, OH. Really??? In the middle of nowhere, hard to travel in and out. Small town mentality for the largest refiner in the country.
- Compliance trumps everything, and there are unnecessary systems, controls, audits, etc. to monitor things normally not an issue elsewhere. There will be controls and processes in place to remove accountability of the individuals (expect everyone to be robots).
Advice to Management
Change is needed. You can’t operate the largest refiner in the U.S. like if was done in the 80’s and 90’s. Oil and Gas companies have evolved and modernized, but Marathon seems not to want or accept that times are different

";"Since the merger, many people have left or been pushed out for speaking up on life safety issues or doing the right thing. Policies are changed when management wants a change, not from a top-down direction but more of "" the fix watching the gen house"". This causes lots of problems when people are more focused on cutting costs and making bonus while having an attitude of that will never happen. 

They have recently been routinely putting people on performance reviews to create a false paper trail in order to fire them. Most of these people have previously always received great reviews and the maximum bonus. 
 No longer the great company it was.

Stop running like a good ole boys club and be committed to your company's values. You need to maintain staff levels to support change and saying people can expect to work twice as hard for less will not help morale.

2020-01-21;Manager;Current Employee;Great company, but at risk of getting left behind;"It is a company with great people, great pay, and great benefits. There are many opportunities from coast to coast, so you could spend your entire career at one company. 

Despite the stigma that often comes with an O&G company, MPC is truly trying to lead the industry in its environmental sustainability efforts, while remaining pragmatic and realistic about the world's demand for affordable and reliable energy. 

Not withstanding the corporate office in Findlay, MPC offers a great deal of work locations across the country that could fit anyone's desired geographic preference and allows those that desire it, to experience different cultures, climates, and cuisines.
";"The CEO is old fashioned and out of touch. Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. 

The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. 

They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. 

Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. 

In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.
Advice to Management
Move the HQ out of Findlay and step into the 21st century with regards to work practices and work/life balance. Diversify the leadership team.
