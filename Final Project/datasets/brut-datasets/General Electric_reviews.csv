2021-09-24;Fleet Engineer;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Great people held down by poor organization;"+ Some of the people are just brilliant and experts in their fields + Everyone works pretty collaboratively (except for between a tier 2 business, see below) + The work can be pretty fulfilling depending on what you're working on + They have permissive leave which is great to take advantage of the summer and skiing in the winter.
";"- No raises in 2 years for the entire business is unsustainable, along with very little acknowledgement by management that it is a problem - Leadership communication is poor. Imagine your favorite politician ducking a debate question and you have what it looks like when upper leadership answers a question in an ""all-hands"" meeting. - There are many legacy systems that can be extremely hampering to innovation and positive change. - Organizational change seems to comes in waves where we swing from one mode of operation and then back to the next every time upper management changes every 12-18 months. This erodes standard ways of doing work and causes people to fall back on informal channels to get work done (which falls apart completely when someone leaves or changes roles). - Specific issue aligning a tier 2 business that is owned by GE but operates as if its independent. Their goals seem completely divorced from the GE units they operate with leading to lost opportunities for GE as a whole.

The company continues its path of continuous improvement, refining its focus on the top lines of business, etc.
";"For the SW-Dev processionals, it is probably good to know that the company is actually industrial rather than SW-development-oriented, more of an Operational excellence focus. There are islands of excellent SW Development teams and to be a part of those is really fun but those are quite segregated and the leadership might not be in the same mindset. Hence, if your passion is in SW development, you may be better off focusing on an SW-product-driven company.

";"Job security is based solely on a seniority/buddy merit system instead of performance. Performance can burn you out and will only make your daily job easier via respect from Union mechanics who can make your job easy or impossible. It's a two sided place. Union and Salary. Both sides eat their own based on personality or likeability. It's a highschool with immature baby boomers manipulating their way to a pension. The lack of training and accountability makes it an interesting social gathering.

";"Recent years GE has taken a hit financially and the culture has become extremely toxic. Leadership changed over the course of the last two years and lots of org restructured. Got rid of base employee cost across the US in large numbers and eventually workload is extremely high with no backfill on roles. Promotions across the board have stopped/halted or seen very rarely. People’s compensation has been stagnant as well. And I think the most important part is the burnout culture it has created and we see all across orgs

";"Former CEO made terrible business decisions that nearly drove the company into the ground. Working level employees constantly being told they aren’t good enough when the poor business position was due to the decisions of the CEO and upper management. Constant layoffs and threats of more layoffs really wears one down and it has been deflating to see so many good people laid off because of the former CEO’s bad decisions and politics. Layoffs used to be based on performance, the more recent ones were political (poor performers protected by labor laws in their home country versus high performers being let go because their home country did not have the same labor protections). So despite the fact that I’ve overall rated the company on the high side, I don’t think I would recommend a friend to work at GE.

";"*GE is currently heavily white male, and senior leadership and HR seem to be pursuing a ""purge"" of white males using several tactics: ....*Have established racial and gender quotas for hiring and promotions ....*Have regular Problem Solving Reports (PSR's) and Action Plans explicitly intended to reduce the proportion of white male employees in the company ....*The standard annual performance review includes a ""9-blocker"" where all employees are ranked against one another; in this 9-blocker, all employees are highlighted in a special color for extra consideration, except for white US males (females highlighted in pink, US non-white highlighted in blue, international highlighted in green) ....*Regularly promote ""Affinity Groups"" to celebrate all groups but Caucasians and males ....*Have cancelled all mid-career programs and tuition reimbursement ....*Have cancelled the pension and generally reduced benefits ....*Continue to focus resources on early career development, and hiring non-white-males to replace the ones they are scaring off ....*White males are generally not hired or promoted except as a last resort (which still happens often, simply due to the sheer number of qualified white male applicants) *This creates a fairly toxic culture, where white males feel they are viewed as ""the problem"" and non-white-males feel that they are viewed as ""diversity hires"" (an incredible disservice to all of our amazing, talented, hard-working employees) *Ironically, the company is largely led by white males at the executive level, and they wholeheartedly support the purge of other white males beneath them (presumably because it is a great PR move for them, and it keeps them safe) *The company preaches integrity and candor, but everyone knows that they are not allowed to question the company's new focus on discriminating against its own employees based on gender and skin color. *Not surprisingly, GE currently has a problem with attrition (including with ""diverse"" employees), as many subject matter experts flee the company

2020-09-28;Senior Software Engineer;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Great people, sad to leave;"Working in the GE New Orleans office was lovely. It was the easiest job I've ever had. The people were nice, we had permissive leave so I took roughly 5 weeks vacation per year and never heard any complaints from the management. It was super corporate, but I attribute that as the reason why they could pamper us so well.
";"They closed the office as a whole and laid off the 100 or so employees. This was a result of the long term effects of Covid-19. That said, GE does have a very real philosophy of looking at the numbers and cutting costs in any way possible, even if it's heartless and short sighted. I realize this is standard for any company this large, but as a result of it, any long term employee there is well aware that they need to shift their position regularly to match whatever is the most profitable side of the business at the time. The only thing you can count on at GE is CHANGE.

I am never bored with my own ability to be constantly learning while working through my projects. There is opportunity to succeed and fail by your own merit and on your terms. The company is going through a restructuring in both physical and mental culture shift. It is slow but moving in the right direction even in some of the oldest shops.
";"Times are tough - there is no sugarcoating it. People are burned out and having to take on roles that previously were held by multiple people. There was a lot of fat to trim in the company but it unfortunately bleeds down to the manufacturing floor primarily. There are not enough millennials who want to come in and work in an older company and facility and that is what GE needs more of to maintain longevity.

2020-10-12;Technical Product Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Elitist Culture;"Amazing learning experience Global exposure Great opportunity to solve complex & interesting problems Work with really intelligent people
";"GE has an elitist culture. It's part of the reason for their current turmoil. They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs. It's nerve-wracking to work there, never knowing which department they will completely dissolve next.

2020-02-26;Accountant;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Join a career accelerating program;"1. Unlimited PTO, you just have to get it approve by your manager. 2. In most offices (if not all), have a relaxed dress code. Not having to dress in business casual is a bigger deal than you may think. It would be hard for me to work with a company that doesn't have a relaxed dress code now. 3. Great work flexibility
";"1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.

2019-12-11;Design Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Great technology terrible work balance;"Cutting edge technology, advanced engineering. Cincinnati are has great wellness medical center that provide many free heath, nutritional and other health screening services.
";"No work balance, global teams force required work odd hours, understaffed. US engineers have to cover for lack of knowledge due to constant turn over at global places since GE is not competitive globally. Global places are covered by labor laws by limited hours and guarantied vacation that has to be compensated but US engineers with long unpaid hours as result US salary people also do not take adequate vacation. Very high stress as ""beating continues until moral improves"". Company constantly chipping away benefits. Limited - not competitive 401k investment choices. Matching company contribution is payed at the end of the year another chip of benefits so if somebody leave before end of the year they do not have to pay it. Low chance of promotion in USA as GE moves more and more engineering to global places.

";"Too many strategy pivots -- seems like every day we were pursuing a different set of customers and had different product goals. A highly political, large organization organized in large centralized ""empires"" silos, without a great deal fo urgency or agility. Often slow to complete projects and show forward momentum, preferring over-documentation to delivering business value. Engineering makes all product decisions, while UX is working on cute animations, and Product is busy doing sales.

The company also still spends a lot of time and effort on providing leadership training programs at every stage of career.
";"GE needs to get back to the basics of focusing on great products, great customer service and long term growth (and turnaround) strategy as opposed to quarterly short-term metrics that hurt the long term strategy. A sense of ownership has dissipated over the years while focusing on inorganic growth and short term metrics.
