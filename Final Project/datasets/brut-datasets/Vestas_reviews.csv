The trick is start high and trick them in the door. Then work to death until they realize what's happening. Worked here for 6 years. Never seen anyone even close to retirement. Only people getting fired constantly along with zero loyalty. They're good at tricking you into believing there's something there though.

";"Management may as well not even exist. They care about one thing; how the world sees them, and they will do anything to meet that expectation, They put that far above safety, employees, and even there customers. There leadership is atrocious however, they'll preach a lot about how great they are and how they do things better than other companies such as communication, safety, and organization(or there term 5S) but these are fallacy's they only tell you in orientation because they have an extremely high turn over rate.

Cons

";"High turnover due to toxic management. Very low upward mobility. Nepotism. Upper management is not transparent with its workers at all. You can tell certain supervisors and higher ups think they are superior by how they talk to you. The upper management also only pays lip service to listening to employee suggestions. Lastly, despite blowing a lot of hot air on the subject, they are really lax with their safety standards.
