2021-08-06;Customer Care Specialist;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Not the worst, not the best.;"Its a company that will take care of you, but you have to do your job near perfect. Awesome coworkers Different Schedule Choices Decent Benefits Good incentives Bonuses for good performance.
";"Mandatory Overtime. You may have to stay over your shift because of a little rain. Storms can mean 12 hour shifts for a week to a few weeks in a row with no time off. Schedule Bids. I put above there are schedule choices, but depending on your performance you may not get a schedule that works for you when there are new shift bids. Different departments have conflicting information, but it's your fault if you get something wrong because of it. Sales shouldn't be required. Period, but if you don't make them, you get in trouble. Training is a mess right now since they implemented new systems. Some things were over trained, others not nearly enough. Depending on your Supervisor and team will determine if you do well. They care way too much about call times, yet expect you to throw in sales and other information, plus the new system that takes way too long to navigate.

2021-08-30;Customer Service Representative;Former Employee, less than 1 year;Not worth it;"The Benefits package is decent
";"Very negative environment. The first week, I was told more ways of how I could get in trouble and disciplined than actual training. Call center environment that is stuck in time from about 20 years ago. Extremely micromanaged environment. In the interview, they ask if you have a cell phone. What they don't tell you is that they are routing all the calls through your cell phone while you are working from home and have your cell connected on a call the entire day. Then they tell you that you can't use your phone at all or they will know it and you will be disciplined for it. They had a trainer and 3 supervisors watching 15 people do computer training modules on camera while people are talking. They dont trust people enough to do a computer training module and test without watching you on camera. They care more about tracking you than you actually retaining the training content. The training is rushed and large amounts of documents are referenced that you are expected to know, but not given time to read them. You are put on the phones after one week of training and then ""coached"" on the things you are doing wrong.

I was told to stay late or come in on my Friday off to help the team in other areas because they're behind. The pay is not the best when compared to my area.

2021-06-15;Lead IT Business Analyst;Current Employee;Overall good company - salary for long-time employees not so great;"Overall stability and culture of the company is good. Leadership does attempt to do the right thing most of the time and values employees.
";"HR and process for promotions/salary increases is pure hell. Anytime you get a ""promotion"" or a salary increase for being a highest contributor it does not reflect the work or the person getting the promotion or increase. Does not provide a lot of drive to want to do better when you do not feel like your work is compensated fairly. So much red tape for management to provide increases and promotions and then when you do (if you are already at the company) it is dis-heartening especially when you can come right off the street and make the middle or even more of where your salary should be but someone who just got a promotion to that same pay class only gets 2-3% and is barely over the minimum for the job.

";"Training is about a month and will not prepare you for pretty much 80% of what your actual job entails. Rules and quality are constantly changing. Floor support always has a different answer and it’s your fault if you get the wrong one. Oh yeah and the system is constantly crashing and that will sometimes be your fault too. Also when I applied for this job no one told me I had to make sales each month or be at risk of termination. That wasn’t in the job description. Yet here I am.

2021-07-15;Customer Care Representative;Current Employee, more than 1 year;It's Fine, but soul-sucking;"Reasonable work hours (40-hour/week with OT), remote jobs available, easy to get time off. At least right now, there's time in between calls so you're not slammed with back-to-back calls with no room to breathe. Don't know if that'll be true in the future or not.
";"It's a call center job, so some people like it, some don't. Basically a sales position masquerading as customer service. Floor support and training is a joke. Nothing they teach you beyond uber-basics is going to prepare you for the real-deal. Floor support rarely assists the reps if they have questions or technical issues and usually they're rude and dismissive. While I like my supervisor, I've heard bad things about other supervisors, so that'll be hit or miss.

Adherence for call times is unrealistic. You're basically back to back on every call and if you try to take a break or be detailed with calls, its seen as a negative. They rate your performance on how quickly you can get customers on and off the phone, but tout that they want the best customer service. You can't have both. If you're the kind of person that can let stuff roll off your shoulders and you can handle the pressure, then this could be a good place for you to grow.

Unique job to have and they give you everything you need to do the job including a company vehicle and corporate card. Looks good on a resume. Pays well and weekly. Short term, this is a steady gig to pay the bills.
";"Grey area rules that leadership can break if they want to and lack of communication from leadership. It feels like we are never told the whole truth, even worse, it feels like you’re getting lied to your face. Failure to deliver on three major promises: growth, “plenty of” OT (got none and never will), and a 6 month title change/pay bump. It hasn’t even been a year and people are quitting for something else. The department is growing large too quickly. A byproduct of this growth is that it has veered from a family model feeling to a corporate one. Guys feel like drones and morale is low.

As a DBA, when on-call, you would get at least 3 or 4 calls in the middle of the night. Sometime, you would get no sleep at all. Then, Duke would require you to be in the office for your ""regular"" 8 hours. I put that in quotes, because what they really expected was more like 9 or 10, regardless if you had all of your work done.

It's a fun place to work for software development, using the latest cloud technologies with management receptive to fresh ideas, researching, and problem-solving. Software developers are respected. Been here over a year and only asked to work on a Sat once for a big, rare upgrade, never asked to stay late and encouraged to take vacation (3 weeks) as well as take company-paid training. 401K match is 4% then up to 6% matching, which has been great. Can work remotely if I'm sick or have an appointment at home which is nice. Speaking up, collaboration, helping others is highly encouraged.
";"A few teams could follow the Agile approach to their benefit a bit more closely. Some get a little ""too eager"" to push forward without requirements, but they do welcome honesty and pushback if needed. A bit more focus on lowering customer costs in order to keep them happy would be welcome, but that's out of my area of expertise in my department.

2020-10-01;Engineering Technologist;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Ready to be nothing more than a glorified retail worker? This place is for you!;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.
";"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.

2019-11-03;Network Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Decent Salary / Horrible Environment;"The pay is decent, but not what it used to be with the recent layoffs and cut backs.
";"It's a really uptight atmosphere. If you think you'd enjoy working at Google, you will not like it there. It's a sad place to work and all of upper management, have very little care or value of employees. I saw people with 20 years with the company, get dismissed with a week's notice, some with none. Like many companies, the employees are great, but ""management"" is feckless, and biased. It is the antithesis of what happy, tightknit family-run businesses are about.

There is no communication from upper management about posibilities of getting the Duke position. While working as a contractor, no benefits, raise is about 18 cents a year ( yes no joke), no bonuses, no promises of keeping the employment, no retirement. So, before you quit your career, which has all the benefits with retirement, raises, days off, payed holidays and get sucked into empty promises at Duke Energy think twice. It is very sad to say but it is not worth it......

Over half the company can retire in 5 years. The older generation is backing up the pipeline for personal promotion and advancement, which hurts the company.

The beach and major amenities are nearby and the cost of living is rather low. Plenty of ""opportunities"" to succeed. For engineering: for the most part documentation is strong making information relatively trivial to find. Engineering management is very good and fair. Many meals are comp'd by the company which definitely shows the company is showing us we are worthwhile. They also have an amazing relocation package (there are significant cons to it, see cons).
";"Chronic acceptance of plant problems by management and personnel. They must close their eyes while they are saying ""we will not accept problems"". If you end up identifying longstanding problems(like they tell you they want you to do) it becomes your problem to solve them. It can be quite frustrating and overwhelming. Coworkers are thickheaded and not receptive to innovative ideas and can be extremely cynical and negative - it is contagious. There is a reason why this facility has struggled for years to even simply make par with regulating organizations - the culture of its employees is terrible! More on that: personnel are very clichy. If you don't agree with them on issues be prepared for your job to be impossible. There is a subliminal level of harassment to this. In all honesty I'd have left within a couple on months of the job initially; however, per the relocation agreement, I'd owe every cent of a hefty sum back if I left within two years of my hire date. There are still quite a few new hires that have left within a couple months of being hired and paid back the money anyway just to get out. I am counting down to my two year mark.

2015-12-09;IT Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;If you work in IT, not a great company to work for;"Very flexible work schedule and teleworking policy. Work/life balance is generally quite easy to maintain.
";"Individual contributors are buried under excessive layers of incompetent management that are all desperate to prove how useful they are. Turnover rate for top talent is pretty high, and what's left bubbles up into management, mostly based on seniority, not skill. Any attempt at innovation or original thought is quickly squashed by a pervasive ""this is the way we've always done it"" monoculture. Very slow to adapt. Pay for IT jobs is way below market average. Benefits are not what they used to be, so it's become even less competitive than it was in years past, and that's not saying much. Management has basically been a game of musical chairs for years now. Re-orgs several times a year means that your manager is pretty much guaranteed to not have a clue about what you specialize in, but that doesn't stop most of them from from micromanaging you and telling you how you should do your job.

They paid for my college and gave me the opportunities I needed to make a great career. I started in the union and worked my way into a management position. The aging workforce at Duke will give me and others many more opportunities to work into other interesting jobs over the next few years. The benefits are great too. We enjoy good medical, dental and eye care benefits and a great vacation policy.
";"Duke has yet to complete the total combination of the latest merger with Cinergy. There are a lot of problems that are handled differently between the Carolina plants and the Midwest plants. The cultures are so different it will be hard to ever make the entire company look the same.

2016-03-31;Lead;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Headed in the wrong direction;"Duke is a laid back environment. Most of the company leaves by noon on Fridays and everyone works relaxed hours. Benefits are good, aside from the health insurance.
";"Since the merger with Progress there has been nothing but trouble. Progress was in financial ruins due to management running that company into the ground. Unfortunately much of that management has been brought into Duke. There are numerous managers (upper level) that do not have degrees nor the competence and training to do their job. The Progress side is like a fraternity that sticks together and promotes each other within. It is very disheartening. They are quickly running out the talent and bringing this once fine company down. I have seen employees use their company cards for lunch every day of the week as well as company vehicles given to employees that have no need. Instead of making employees move to Charlotte they allow a large number of individuals to travel almost weekly on the company’s dime to Charlotte headquarter. The fleecing is alarming. I am concerned not only as an employee but as a customer of Duke as well. This company is in serious need of a management over hall.
"
2016-02-13;Customer Service Representative;Former Employee, more than 1 year;The bad outweighs the good;"Unlimited overtime and sales commission. This company would pay $10 per person you setup on load control for resident's heating and cooling systems. Also you could get 80 hours of PTO and 80 hours of sick time upfront. They would also contribute $500 a year to your healthcare spending card.
";"The managers at the call center on Rush St in Raleigh are highly unprofessional and immature. So much gossip and hypocrisy there it was very much like high school. I heard a team lead hang up on several customers. Also, the call volume is extremely high. I'm talking 80-200 calls in queue all day long. Keep in mind this is the largest utility company in the nation. My average phone call was 5 minutes and I would take 100+ calls a day all while adhering to rules to abide by while on the call. Calls are scored. Only accept this job if you absolutely have to. If you like your sanity steer clear. The $$ may be appealing but it's not worth it at all.
"
2015-11-06;Anonymous;Former Employee;Engineer;"Large Company that expands across many disciplines. I find that Duke as a whole is a really good company. Great benefits, flex time, and in my former department Fridays we had off (4-10 schedule).
";"In my division, I found that it was hard to try a different position once you were in your current role. You become the expert and no one really wants to allow you to expand your knowledge on other things. I worked in the Nuclear Division and making moves outside of the Nuclear world within the company proved to be hard at times. So in the nuclear department career development wasn't so expansive unless you were gearing up to be a manage within that particular organization. Again, Duke is huge so the opportunities are there and expand far beyond the nuclear world so it would have been nice to be able to explore some of those options.

If I didn’t have small kids I wouldn’t be complaining because who doesn’t like a nice looking check. But basically you’ll be paying rent but technically not live there because you’ll live at Duke Energy: The CEO got a nice raise but our office in Raleigh is run down , vending machines always taking our money, old computers, computer systems always down, website always down, phone payment system always down which causes high call volume..

Too many layers of management cause important communications to drop into the black hole of , ""I never got the memo."" Benefits cut, pensions cut. Horrible HR (outsourced). Pay is stable but you are expected to work many more hours for the same pay. It's normal for salaried folks (who are not part of management) to work 50 + hours a week with no additional compensation. Employees have so much on their shoulders, and are under so much pressure that I expect many more will suddenly leave or retire. No transparency with changes that affect employee or retiree benefits.
"
2013-12-15;Project Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Stable work but poor management and lower than average salary.;"I have worked for Duke Energy for 35 years, so I am paid a good salary..at least for this area. The benefits are average. Since I have been here so long, I get 6 weeks vacation. That's a great benefit...if I actually get to use it.
";"Compared to other utilities, Duke is well known to be one of the lowest paying utility companies, especially in Nuclear. Compared to other companies, Duke's health care costs are high. Management, at least Nuclear, is not supportive or even respect employees. They often say one thing and do another. They have personally lied to me several times. They point fingers and blame employees but when asked for details they cannot provide facts to support blaming individuals. Expectations for themselves is lower than what they expect of individual workers. Duke expects you to wear a beeper 24/7 and be available for call out and come to work within 75 minutes but there is no compensation for this. They do not respect work/life balance. More and more they expect doing more work with fewer people. They expect workers to just absorb work when people leave.

Great benefits. Although I did later find out I was being paid a decent amount less than the pay band I was on and jobs for similar positions in the area were much higher.
";"My direct manager was great but director level and above didn't seem to be in sync. There was a lot of transition and gaps in leadership which provided a lot of uncertainty with vision and direction. Also, many teams were severely strained with resources while adding more and more projects.

";"In interviews I tell people that I left the company due to the impending merger -- a good politically correct answer. I really left due to my AWFUL manager who was put in his position for one reason and one reason only -- his race, a card he played to get ahead. This individual, because he was uneducated and incompetent, micromanaged, bullied and otherwise made our lives MISERABLE. He piled on work to those of us who would do it, because he had absolutely no control over the slackers who wouldn't.

";"Promotions are generally driven by politics versus performance. Although your performance is measured on a yearly basis, your ability to move up the ladder will require strong networking skills. To accept a good career opportunity, you will have to accept a lower salary to begin. The rapid growth can be a negative as you try to understand the company vision, goals, and culture. The company did not settle into its 1st merger before going into a 2nd recent merger which brought in more new visions, ideas, and new management. Trying to navigate through the continual change can be challenging and stressful.

This amounts to making changes to the mix of energy sources and how they are operated, turning greener and meaner. This means a few things to me, more natural gas power plants and more renewables, but also lots of cost cutting efforts. I feel that Duke Energy is taking the right steps when considering the customers, employees, and public.
";"The change management leaves something to desire. There are a lot of moving parts and some changes result in breaking existing processes. When such instances occur, it leaves a kind of bewilderment with employees as to how we could have missed something like this. In summary, we are changing too many things at the same time.

";"Lower than industry salaries, very low % in merit increases. The corporate culture sometimes feels antiquated with separation in ideology between older employees and younger employees. Budget concerns and employee layoffs is always a concern creating an unpleasant atmosphere. 2 years ago there were tons of ""involuntary"" and ""voluntary"" cuts throughout all of Finance.

Renewables is growing. This position has a flexible schedule, good work life balance.
";"Limitations on moving up within the company, especially in Renewables. Feels like a ""good ol' boys club"". Not a diverse group. Upper Management doesn't understand day to day operations or life in rural areas. Area Managers are not held accountable. If a site manager can talk the talk, nobody will actually look into whether or not that manager is doing their job, following policy or procedures nor if they are holding their staff accountable. This position is very repetitive, and not many extra projects, challenging projects. To move up from this position is difficult because of lack positions within the group that relate to the skill set and background you already have as an SRC. It seems like any experience prior to Duke Energy doesn't count once you have been hired and start looking to move within the company.

Good overall management and leadership. Not the greatest formal benefits, but very flexible with 'informal' benefits - flexible work schedules, bonuses, rewards, etc. Peers in general are good to work with. Managers tend to be promoted from withing, which can be a blessing or a curse.
";"Some 'dead wood' that has been there a long time and no real performance management done to weed them out. Managers not willing to deal with it.

";"As with any large organization, bureacracy and mediocre employees will significantly impede progress. Duke does not really reward performance financially. Everyone gets an annual merit increase between 2.5 to 4 regardless. You can be the most mediocre employee and still get a 2.5%. You can be a true leader, putting everything into it, growing the business and be rewarded with a 3%.

Pros
Very interesting and diverse work. The management is generally very strong and employee oriented. There is potential for growth but you need to develop your own networking system. If you are a recent college grad they have implemented programs that help you learn about the diverse areas of the company. They offer a rotation program in the IT department so you can experience many different facets of IT prior to deciding where you will settle.
Cons
Due to some of the downsizing in recent years, many folks have more work than they can possibly manage. Sometimes it takes a little time to get things processed and completed.

";"One of their biggest pros creates one of their biggest cons. Since they always try and keep employees, you'll find people that don't belong in their roles and simply aren't capable. This is common for many of the older workers who aren't quite to retirement and just looking for a few more years work. It should eventually phase out with the older portion of the workforce.

2017-03-31;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Think twice about working here;"Employees are generally friendly, which helped offset the stressful work environment and long hours. Pay, medical benefits, and PTO are competitive for the market.
";"This company doesn't value competent employees. Underachievers are routinely promoted and picked to manage teams, with distraous results to employee performance and team morale. Management pulls on high performing employees to carry the weight with little recognition. Work/life balance is laughable, especially during severe weather. Your life is driven by daily weather forecasts. Diversity and inclusion is all talk, with no follow through. There are few leadership opportunities for people of color and no diversity training for managers. There is open racism with no repercussions. The company is routinely awarded for its diversity practices, which is puzzling given the realities. HR is ill equipped to lead a 21st century workplace.

";"Play favorites in providing training. Contractor PM's are treated differently than employee PM's. Appears that only women and minorities are offered to convert to employees. Identity appears to trump success in project assignements. Tools to manage budgets are inadequate. There is a lot of bureaucracy and red tape, mostly associated with accounting, to go through to get projects approved past the Commit gate.

";"Despite the obvious success of the company, some departments still use outdated practices, technology, etc. Culture clashes.
