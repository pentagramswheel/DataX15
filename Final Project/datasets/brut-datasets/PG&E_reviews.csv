2021-10-12;Anonymous;Current Employee;Full of disinterested employees who do the bare minimum;"- Good benefits include 401k match & pension.
";"- Large workload of inefficient processes - 90% of workforce is lazy & disinterested. Don't reply to emails or be productive. Just complete work ""the way it has always been done"" - ineffective, inefficient, low quality, poor documentation, no transparency. Complete bare minimum to not be terminated. Do-Nothing employees are drawn to this company like moths to a flame and the 10% who do want to invoke positive change find themselves bashing their heads against the wall day in, day out. Prepare to send 20 follow up emails & have 7 meetings to get a single thing done, waste of time. - Leadership is full of ""Yes men"" who say whatever makes them look good to executives, then don't follow through. Revolving door of executives. Lots of buzz words about tenacity & positivity & leading with love & being the change, only resulting in more busywork without any results. Re-orgs & rolling out new processes every other year is the norm - always in flux & never at performing point in implementation. - CYA culture, finger pointing, no cross-functional cooperation. - Company promises one thing then reneges, leaving employees left holding the bag.

";"The hours are long and the pay isn't great (though the benefits are). It is also mentally challenging to try--on a daily basis--overcome a reputation that precedes and pervades everything that you do.

2021-09-23;Estimating supervisor;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Great Employer;"Excellent benefits and pay. Many opportunities for growth and development. You can live almost anywhere in California. PG&E is a very large employer and has many different areas to work within the company. You can maintain seniority and try very different areas of the business.
";"Media and political criticism for how PG&E has historically been managed bring morale down. There are many natural disasters and that may require longer work times for power restoration depending what department you work in.

2021-10-10;Senior Change Manager;Former Employee, less than 1 year;Inauthentic leadership;"Opportunities to work with very dedicated and smart team members
";"Inauthentic leadership: In CEO all hands meeting, a team member who passed away was mentioned. A moment of silence was requested--it was seconds. This left a very unsympathetic tenor as the rest of the meeting began. A diversity dialogue between leaders was even worse. So much so that I left within a couple of weeks.

2021-09-03;Senior Business Analyst;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Chaos.;"Pay, benefits, providing power for Californian's is a noble purpose, many coworkers are good people.
";"Company is reacting chaotically to decisions by Federal Judge, CPUC, others. Trying to get its baring but constantly changing direction every time an inquiry comes in. A wounded company, not sure if it can recover. Relying on consultants rather than employees.
"
2021-08-04;Leadership;Current Employee, more than 5 years;CPUC (regulator) and internal chaos makes this company a tough one to recommend;"The company has many wonderful people. Great benefits. Post COVID, flexibility to work from home has been great. I think there are areas where it isn't chaos but they are hard to find.
";"Two issues: 1) the CPUC and 2) internally chaotic. The company is disorganized mostly due to an unreasonable regulator (CPUC) and too many competing priorities. The company's spend has doubled but it isn't in labor, labor has been cut dramatically and work has been increased. Work life balance is an issue because it doesn't exist. I do not believe the company is going to improve for the employees. Leadership is a revolving door and I truly think the regulation of PG&E is what cripples the company. It is a bunch of regulators who have no idea how the business even works, trying to feel important. Many of the regulators do not understand the basics of a gas and electrical company yet that is where all our time is spent - explaining it to them.

I expect retention rates to skyrocket. benefits are ok. I know PG&E has a reputation for good benefits, but they get worse and worse every year. you do get the basics covered - health insurance, 3 weeks of vacation, 8 hours of sick time a month.
";"there are some atrocious managers who stay in the job because one or two leaders know them. I wouldn't be surprised if they got half way to tanking the company before anyone did anything about it. salaries can be good, but the company is slow to approve improvements. some leaders just flat out dislike promoting their people, other groups have promotions annually. there is no standard, its left up to the leaders preference.

2021-05-07;Sustainability Specialist;Former Employee, more than 3 years;GREAT benefits, slow to realize change;"GREAT benefits, very comprehensive, and maternity leave is fully supported by Sedgwick Leave reps, making it super easy to make sure you get paid! PG&E is very established, and there are a LOT of processes and norms to break through when you're looking for radical change. That said, those established processes are there for many good reasons, and the duty to serve Californians is always top of mind. Nice people. Great work-life balance, and typically not many folks are working late hours, unless you're on an Emergency Operations shift. Tons of expertise and folks have a long tenure, meaning deep expertise is always around.

2021-03-23;Supply Chain;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Look Elsewhere Before Joining;"Union pay and benefits for engineers is very good. Non union, individual contributors are not treated nearly as well in regards to pay and work assignments. Vacation time, pension, 401k, sick time, are above average. Remote work because of Covid-19 has been great. Not all collogues can work remote unfortunately. Many co-workers try their best.
";"PG&E is a convicted felon. The majority of supervisors, managers, directors, etc. are extremely unqualified to lead. What I've read regarding you have to be a white male to receive advancement opportunities is complete wrong. The company will place a completely unqualified diversity candidate in a role just to meet a quota. There are whole organization with women in the C-suite all the way to the front lines. A high amount of unethical behavior is common throughout the company. ""Speak-Up"" culture is ineffective. There is limited follow-up on concerns. CAP program is used a crutch when no one has an answer who should or when a Leader will not take accountability. There are 6-7000 CAPs in this ineffective program. CEO, VPs, CFO, and Presidents are constantly changing. With this change comes non standardization and continual reorganization.

2021-01-23;Manager;Former Employee, more than 8 years;A great company operating in a difficult environment;"Within management rolls, PG&E is filled with good people trying to do the right thing. The work of providing safe gas and electricity is deeply meaningful, as you feel yourself being in integral part of enabling daily life for all your friends and neighbors. PG&E's a big company, so there's a myriad of different things to do, and the landscape around the company continues to shift rapidly which creates opportunities to re-thing the status quo, and drive change.
";"The highly regulated environment creates a risk averse, and a change averse culture. To some degree that's not a bad thing as one doesn't want their utility to be risk forward. That said, it tends to pressure people to stay in boxes, and inhibits creativity and autonomy. The external environment around the company is very negative, and the company is consistently judged unfairly by the media, and local communities.

2020-09-21;Telecommunications Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;The PGE way to getting old;"The only pro is the great salary and benefits.
";"Be prepared for little empowerment. I called it the ""Mother May I Company"". Way too many chiefs talking to way to many chiefs with little impact on anything. You have to ask for permission from way to many people to do anything. Get ready for a massive amount of nepotism. Tribal knowledge is a must and reserved for insiders only. Record systems are a disaster waiting to happen. Confusion is very commonplace among the rank and file. The corporate culture is to follow the ""PGE"" way regardless of how inefficient it is. Forget any form of ""Best in class"" to be implemented until it receives a good going over by the ""PGE tribal specialist"" so they can label it the ""PGE"" way. The new modified ""PGE"" best in class way usually looks nothing like the original concept. The modified ""PGE"" best in class takes so long to be deployed it will almost always be obsolete before full deployment. You have to learn how to respond to hearing things like ""Manufacturer Discontinued"".

";"Every group is a silo, no group knows what the other is doing so mistakes can happen due to lack of communication. Supervisors spy on other groups and tattle-tell if you are on the internet (even if your job requires it). People from good universities, backgrounds however this makes them pretty arrogant. Most managers and engineers refuse to work with contractors and believe they know best regardless of evidence. Company is not very transparent about issues, and cover up is another word for discretion. Most employees are blindsided by the company official attitude since the newspaper is a better source of news than the internal communication. Supervisors are known to berate their employees vs training them. Union vs non-union jobs are set against each other, and engineers are told to not even think about unionizing and to listen to their union peers so they can pass their info up to management. Benefits are mediocre, 401k contribution is the lowest I ever seen in any company, vacation time is not used up and it's loss due to managers not approving on time. Not many career opportunities, training outside of the office is discouraged and denied all the time. Conference attendance is not funded except for managers, individual contributors are not allowed to go to training or conferences.

";"As can be seen by poor wildfire management and preparation, the upper levels of management have issues doing their jobs correctly. They have a history of not listening to the workers' input until it's too late. Electrical workers were warning management about bad processes and antiquated equipment that could fail for years before the wildfires took place. Turns out profits were more important. Thank goodness the bankruptcy caused share holders to clean house because management before the wildfires was less than satisfactory.

2019-05-10;Project Management;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Morning huddle threat to Safety, Micromanage;"Company benefits. San Ramon location at Bishop Ranch.
";"Last year Gas Organization started daily huddle first thing in the morning. This causes stress and anxiety. Employees are just getting to office, still holding our purses, when we are asked what good and bad happened yesterday. This is complete waste of time. Who remembers what we did yesterday or over the weekend on Friday. Many members in our team just stand there with all their belongings and wait for it to be over so we can go to our desk and start real work. This has been complete waste of time, adding no value. Have asked management to move out the time of huddle, so at least we are able to think about the day before, go through our email...but no one listens. This is just a sneaky way for management to make sure everyone gets to office at a certain time. When is the company going to realize that we are not school kids but professionals, and don't have to be micromanaged. The huddles are not working, get rid of this, so we can be more productive, and look forward to coming to work. The morale is down in our dept. Management only talks about what matters to them, we are not able to solve any problems. You need to start treating us like professionals.

";"Always in crisis management. Doing your job you discover skeletons in PG&E's closet and the company sometimes went to great lengths to keep them quiet e.g. being asked to shred records, being told to communicate via fax because emails could be traced, and being trained face-to-face by lawyers to practice being grilled. These examples were not everyday occurrences, but they happened and they belittled your soul. I left on my own terms, but I am proud to have always questioned and challenged internal management who tried to keep us quiet - I was tired of always having to push things far enough into the public eye to make a difference. I had to keep a special file of my emails notifying legal or safety of potential issues - doing my job, I was sometimes fearful about what I discovered.

";"At this point in the company it is difficult with limited resources.

2020-04-02;Compliance Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Re: If you're not union or management, leave. You've been warned;"Their pension and 401k back then was among the best in any industry. Many volunteer opportunities Lot of job shadowing and mentor ship opportunities as well Many of the employees there were really cool people. Management on the other hand have become a toxic club. They encouraged zero empathy. They are so far from their advertised culture, it's not funny.
";"If you're not part of the union, you will get the short end of the stick on raises, bonuses, and anything else. They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.

2019-07-08;Senior Cyber Security Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Good pay, bad mgmt, no flexibility to work remote;"Pay is above average for cyber security roles. Hour expectaions are low, meaning theres little pressure to complete work quickly (until theres a crisis). I have a lot of autonomy. Even with the bankruptcy, am fairly secure in my position. Little outsourcing to other geographies.
";"All of my observations apply to IT and Cybersecurity only. Average output and work ethic in these groups is extremely low. Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours. Facilities outside of San Francisco are often very basic or even shoddy. If considering a position outside of SF, make sure to tour the work site. Being outside of SF is also a career disadvantage unless your work site is a center for your org.

2019-07-26;Expert Business Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;At best an unethical organization, at worst, a corrupt one;"Expectations below director level are minimal. Low caliber of employees and leaders, easy to produce ""good work"". Can arrive at 10 and leave at 3 everyday with an hour lunch no questions asked.
";"Besides being roughly 50% owned by hedge funds at the moment (never a good thing for a public utility to be owned by an entity that simply wants to make a profit, its counter to the business model), the first item of note is the fact that internal politics and bureaucracy are pushed to the extreme here. The company lacks controls and accountability and believe me, people take advantage. There are good people but few and far between. Many people do virtually nothing all day long. The company in general talks a big game of ""change"" but utterly unwilling to do so in practice. Status quo rules here, how many times did I hear ""don't rock the boat"". Morale is low, employees are generally unfriendly. Lots of older, legacy staff who still believe the company's modus operandi is that of the 1980's, i.e. telling you not to ask them a question where they have to think and find someone else. A general lack of problem solving ability, will to do so, and execution. You must review safety procedures before every meeting, which gets condescending and repetitive. We are all adults, it should be assumed we know how to climb stairs,etc without instructions how to do so at nauseaum. Rampant nepotism and favoritism. Horrible, decrepit facilities akin to the DMV. Lots of older employees preparing to retire with institutional knowledge not handed down to the next generation. In summary, this place is a disaster, no wonder they are constantly dealing with the PR disaster de jour.

2019-03-22;Mapping Technician;Current Employee, less than 1 year;PG&E Refused to reschedule interview exam after I had to attend a FUNERAL for my grandfather out of state;"Quick response, but no regards to personal emergencies. I had unexpectedly lost my grandparent, the first loss of my immediate family, and had to fly out of state that same week after his death. I was required to take an exam within this same week. I go to school and work full time, as well as attending a last minute service for my grandfather. I emailed them to inform them of my circumstances as to why I was not able to take this exam. They had absolutely no care in the world and I was still required to take the exam by the deadline. Absolutely absurd, I will never work for a company who has NO CARE about their employees.

2016-02-11;Field Engineer;Current Employee;I'm here to stay;"PG&E is one of few companies left that offer a pension to employees. On top of the above average benefits one normally sees at a career level job, PG&E offers multiple additional resources and perks such as discounts and complimentary services, too many to mention. Example being a discount on the utility bill (25% off - if it's with PG&E), Major cell carrier bill discounts, travel, loans, commodities etc. PG&E really cares about health and well being and strives to reduce work related injuries (from desk jobs to field work) by offering ergonomic assessments and equipment to reduce fatigue.
";"Being a big corporation, change moves slowly and bureaucracy is common gossip around the office. When there is change, it's usually across the board which is both disruptive and can put people out of positions even if their performance is exemplary since they are now a gold plated square peg for a round hole. Though upper management (which there is many layers of) does put effort to reposition these employees its can sometime be hard for the peons to get themselves heard with results.

2017-09-04;Principal Business Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Not in a good place.;"-The people you work with are great and one of the reasons why I stayed as long as I did. There's alot of smart and passionate people there with alot of years of experience. For people that are new to the industry it's a great opportunity to learn from experts. For the most part people have no problem sharing their knowledge with you, all it takes is a coffee or lunch every now and then. -Easily accessible location from East Bay... Peninsula side not so much.
";"-Out of touch. Their business will continue to shrink because of all the CCA's and renewables eating into their market share. Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.
