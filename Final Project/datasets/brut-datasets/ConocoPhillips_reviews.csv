";"Typical corporate America culture, nothing special here. For me, this was a con. For some, that's okay. Experience can vary drastically depending on manager. There are great ones and there are awful ones that have no business leading people. The reason I left the company is because I had an awful supervisor that was only looking after themselves. Don't expect this environment to be conducive for young professionals looking to make a difference. It can be quite stagnant at times (during the downturns and up swings). Experience can also vary drastically depending on where you are located, such as the corporate headquarters or a business unit (BU). I spent time in both, and prefer the culture in the BU, by far.

I've never had any resistance to have to take time off or leave the office temporarily to take care of life stuff. Relaxed work environment. Very flexible work schedule. Lots of bonus activities going on. Pot-lucks, work picnics, holiday parties. Houston office is very nice.
";"The ceiling for how technical you can get into software development is fairly low, if that matters to you. Although they have SPIRIT values that encourage everyone to follow certain values. The compensation system passively encourages you to make make your peers look worse to allow you to look better and get a better raise. Not remote work friendly. Business Casual when it is basically unneeded. Many employees are very resistant to change. As of Dec. 2019 the Bartlesville office could use a refresh especially compared to the brand new Houston office.

";"Professionals are expected to continually work more hours than standard full-time workload.

Performance rating system is almost punitive. Above-average performance ratings are extremely hard to get, unless you are one of the ""chosen"".

As everywhere, there are occasional people who only care about themselves, what's in it for them, how it makes them look, etc. With good navigation they can often be avoided.
";"When prices are low formal training opportunities vanish. Old-school culture and management values employees who tow the line, and who mimic and parrot. The status quo is that the company sheds about 5 - 10% of employees every 2-3 years on average. When prices are low, the cuts are much more significant and frequent. Fewer career opportunities as assets are shed during the downturn.

Big city work in a small town setting. You will work the hardest for the first 5 years than any where. But after that, you become wise enough to delegate. So don't leave even if the temptation is there. Excellent bonus opportunities, good benefits, a bowling alley, and gym built in.
";"Difficult to be dynamic in your career without moving from Bartlesville, lots of glass ceilings. They are high, but when you are there, you will have to move to get out from under it. Also, compensation is high at first and slow to rise until the 5 year mark. Attrition, specifically in young talented professionals, is high because of this.

2017-02-21;Geologist;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Oil and Gas Exploration;"The company has strong heritage assets, and may kind caring people. There are many smart talented people. However, overarching corporate vision and smart business decision making are lacking. The work scheduling with every other friday off schedule is fantastic. I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff. Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.
";"Politics, bureaucracy, bloated, games. Let me give a disclaimer that I was laid off. While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game. Reason is, these people are still employed and will be the next set of managers in the next 5 years... the cycle continues.

2016-12-15;Facilities Engineer;Former Employee, more than 10 years;I am Glad I got to Work Here;"The pay is good. They treat their employees well, at least when commodity prices are high. When ConocoPhillips was an integrated oil company, there were opportunities to do a wide variety of work all over the world including upstream, downstream, and midstream.
";"It is a large company, so things tend to move slowly, and you have to follow some crazy rules. The oilfield is also not a fun place to work when times are bad. And after the company split into upstream and downstream components, ConocoPhillips continues to specialize more and more on Lower 48 shale plays. This may be a good business decision, but it limits career opportunities for mechanical engineers.

2016-10-25;Energy Trader;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Solid Company that promotes from within;"COP is generally a good place to work that promotes from within. If you stick around, they will give you opportunities that maybe would be unlikely elsewhere. If you want to have a career here with the potential to move through different job assignments, it is possible. Corporate culture is positive, it seems that people here generally care about you, benefits are industry competitive. Good location in Energy Corridor, beautiful complex, and great onsite gym, medical and dental clinics, cafeteria.
";"Because they promote from within, you will find some managers that are truly ill-equipped to be in management. The company did not position itself very well to weather the oil price downturn through means other than headcount reduction. The Executive level decision to not hedge crude oil production as an independent E & P company because it is a ""zero sum game"" is considered by many to be the riskiest strategy of all.

2016-08-08;N/A;Former Employee;Great Place to Intern;This company really cares about your career development and personal growth, more than I've seen anywhere else. New hires go through a rotation program in which they change their job every 15 months or so. This gives exposure to different types of jobs and the ability to learn significantly more skills as a result. The people are super friendly and everyone is supportive of each other's success. ;"dering how poorly oil is doing it's incredible how well new hires and interns are treated. The intern program is fantastic. They have another ""job fair"" once you start the internship for your exact position, giving you many options of what you'd like to spend the summer doing. There's all sorts of fun events throughout the summer for interns. They have summer rumble, which is a competition between new hires and interns (via volleyball, basketball, trivia nights, etc.) that goes on throughout the entire summer. They take you on a trip to Houston on the company plane to visit the Houston campus - we also spent an evening at Top Golf when we went there.
Cons
Layoffs. Though it seems like new hires are pretty much immune. I was an IT Intern. As a CS major, some of the opportunities within the company seem limited being that this is not a tech company. In addition, some people find the work less interesting compared to the work they could find at a tech company. It all depends on the specific job role and team you end up working with.

2016-06-24;Financial Planner and Analyst;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Incredible Culture;"COP has a very collaborative culture that encourages employees to learn from each other and share knowledge that improves processes. Having 9/80 schedules are also a great benefit, however depending on the group you are in the flexibility may or may not be there. COP has a great retirement package- 401K match AND pension. For finance there is a rotational program so you are constantly being exposed to new things.
";"There are a lot of requests that take a lot of time to put together, but are required to be put together quickly. Requests for scenarios is not a bad thing, but when you are running a scenario on everything under the sun that just gives someone peace of mind instead of driving decision making it can be exhausting for the people at the bottom.

2016-07-10;Progect Engineer;Former Employee;Former Engineer;"Compensation package is average for large independents. System integrations have reduced the silo effect between departments thereby reducing project delays and budget wars during declining revenue. Department management uses all tactics available to protect department budgets which included department staff.
";"The decline in oil and gas prices have affected the company as per all companies with exploration and production (upstream) operations. ConocoPhillips spun off refining into a new company they named Phillips 66, thereby losing revenue in the more stable downstream market where jobs typically pay less for equivalent years of experience but with less layoffs.

";"The problem is the lower management levels can be filled with people that you have to wonder how they got the job, then you realize the good ole boy system is how. If you aren't in the cool kids club you are definitely out. I watched people get promoted and get raises based on nothing more than how much they were liked by mgmt but that is probably true most everywhere. The company hit some hard times lately due to the drop in oil so I understand the frozen salaries the last few years and the drop in benefits (which are still good). The CEO should realize he isn't above sacrificing though, big raises and bonuses sour the employee's mood when they get nothing and are laid off.

2016-03-08;N/A;Former Employee, more than 8 years;As ye sow, so shall ye reap;"Large oil company with global opportunities. The new CEO, Ryan Lance, has his hands full and is doing the best he can with a lousy situation largely created by the prior CEO, Jim Mulva.
";"The prior CEO was less than competent when it came to succession management and leadership development; his constant firing and churning of the upstream leadership and risk aversion led to sub-optimized investment performance. As a result of the $34B writedown of 2009, he was named the worst CEO of the first decade of this century by Business Week magazine. Rightly so. He paid too much for assets (he preferred to by oil & gas reserves since he couldn't find any), ran off talented middle & senior level management, dis-incentivized the organic development of new assets (hasn't found any new oil in 16 years), developed no deepwater capabilities, alienated petroleum engineers and geologists, kept investment strategy secret (even to his own staff), sold off valuable assets, kept lousy assets despite good offers and split the integrated company right before the inevitable cyclical downturn of the oil & gas industry. This has left a husk of an upstream company which is incapable of operating like a smaller independent oil company, is struggling to retain what little talent is left and is scraping for investment cash flows (cut the dividend last month).

";"There can sometimes be too much red tape in order to get approval for projects, even the low cost projects. This leads to delays and makes an engineer spin his wheels.

";"As with all jobs, satisfaction depends largely on your manager. Unfortunately, where I work we have poor management. They are vindictive, institutionalized, sociopathic, paranoid, and indecisive. The company as a whole is trying to be an independent, but until they get senior leadership with and independent mindset they will never actually do it. All the areas where they are wasting money will never go away, because all the people who dreamed it up are still in leadership and simply not capable of letting go. Cronyism thrives at COP and the best opportunities and performance ratings are saved for the cronies. Ability to survive in low commodity price environment is questionable. Cronyism and corporate politics is comparably chronic and extreme. Leadership moves frequently and it is rare for a Business Unit leader to be at a location more than two years.

Culture was great, though low-commodity pricing has lowered employee morale and the way employees truly used to care for one another (people do crazy things just to keep the job).
";"From the beginning of the year, the low commodity pricing has had a HUGE impact on the company. From the company withholding annual raises, retention bonuses, promotions, relocations, etc all in the name of not having to do layoffs, the company STILL conducted multiple layoffs. The first round supposedly was based on performance, but it has become evident though other rounds that it is surely a game of politics--with those having good relationships with people of power sticking around and those who don't (despite great performance and high ratings) being let go. It is now a high stress environment, with those of us remaining not knowing our fate. There are certainly good people still around, if you happened to be in the right place (group still actively performing work) at the right time, but there are many people still present who most certainly should be gone.

Older colleagues were welcoming, patient and willing to spend time with the new-hire engineers to get them up to speed. The salary and benefits I considered generous.
";"Once it became clear that layoffs were impending, we all lived under this threat for many, many months and the stress affected work and relationships. These circumstances are not unique to this company, but the manner in which layoffs were conducted here was particularly brutalizing and insensitive and the decisions concerning who stayed and who was laid off seemed particularly arbitrary, i.e. some very strong, motivated performers were shown the door while some mediocre talents remained. My lasting impression is that shareholders are of singular importance whereas employees are expendable...a very shortsighted approach. Not all companies take this view.

Many Supply Chain Management new hires forfeited alternative offers due to this developmental program. Management has not delivered on their promises to grow and rotate their new hires/personnel. Many sit in the same roles year after year after year not growing and not developing. Some of the new hires are given preferential treatment due to political connections and are moved around frequently. The rest of the new hires are left to sit in their positions. It's been disheartening to witness the politics and bureaucracy that takes place within this organization.

As an engineer, if you were willing to be coached/taught and work hard there was lots of opportunity to develop professionally.

Noticed more women & young people in leadership roles and an employee friendly work environment for salaried employees. At the time, $$ was available for internal and external training. **Noticed some complaints were regarding ""location"". I think it is important to remember the industry and the areas of operation for COP. Bartlesville, OK is not the worst place in the portfolio, it could be a lot worse. **
";"Pre-Spin Off - Spent majority of early career pre spin-off and can't recall major complaints.

Post Spin Off - Moved to a new BU, and found that supervision/management was not interested in taking advantage of the strengths of its employees.

I have always been treated well here, respected by my peers, and been able to work hard and contribute what I know to be a proactive part of any team, voice my opinion, and help to streamline processes where I can. I love the fact that even though I am assigned to a specific team, I have the freedom to branch out and help just about any team that needs my help! I learn a lot from others by having this type of freedom and I can still support the people I work for and help others as well.
";"The oil market overall is and has been downsizing for some time now due to pricing. That is the scary part of working in this business. You never know if you are going to be laid off or not in the next round of layoffs. It's a very devastating feeling that lingers in your mind and it does affect you. I don't care what anyone says it's on just about every person's mind as we go through these hard times. I was around in the 80's/90's when we went through this then and have seen hundreds of my co-workers laid off. I have some friends that were laid off in 2014 that still cannot find work.

Houston location excellent with gym, cafeteria, covered parking, access to upper management and access to career opportunities at the peer companies.
";"Initiatives associated with diversity and inclusion feel to the wayside with the downturn in the industry. Divergent efforts associated with information technology with the organization. CIO sets the vision for the organization but middle management sets the goals and objectives. The middle management efforts are often in conflict with the efforts of the CIO. Class systems associated with university, birth place, work location, degree, age, sex, color, religion, ethnic background, national origin, sexual orientation.

Work / Life balance in my office location was great. The gym facilities were pretty great too, and I liked that they were open a lot. They even had some semi-organized leagues you could join which was a lot of fun.
";"Your coworkers, your boss, everyone who works there seems to hoard information / knowledge in order to make themselves look better and you look worse. I worked there before the split, but I know people who are still there and people who started working there after the split - and the same problem is still going on every where across all departments. Training options were basically non-existent for the Bartians - the only exception being the IT college hire kids.

The people in Bartlesville were great. Really enjoyed the culture of the company. Very open, very positive. Core hours are 9-3, but as long as you are there during those hours you can come in and leave whenever you want so long as you get your 9 hours in. Very helpful on days when you have appointments or travel and want to leave a couple hours early.
";"Part of the reason they pay so well is because people don't want to be in Bartlesville, OK. It is a nice small town if you have a family and want to settle down. But for the younger generation, it just doesn't have much to offer. The flexible schedule is nice, but when you have to travel outside of town to do most fun stuff, it gets a little old. If you have grown up in larger cities, the town will definitely be an adjustment.

2014-11-20;Anonymous;Former Employee;Great development opportunity in a low risk, low stress environment.;"For the Midwest, it is by far one of the best companies you could work for. Phenomenal benefits. IT has a very low stress working environment compared to more ""tech"" oriented companies. Great place for someone looking to settle down, start a family, and embrace the ""work to live, not live to work"" mentality. This is definitely an organization ran by an older generation. Bartlesville really can be a great place to live if you learn to make the most of it. Job security is unmatched.
";"As with any large corporation, ConocoPhillips moves slowly and has its fair share of bureaucracy. In my experience, the IT organization is more oriented towards those wanting to settle down than those wanting to move up or do something incredibly progressive. There is significant internal resistance to making waves. Employees are encouraged to keep their head down and follow directions. New ideas generally take around two years to implement. Budget cycles control the fate of most projects. If the oil price drops, almost all ""new"" IT projects will be frozen for the year.

I have heard many new hires say they are already planning their next career move solely because of the location and I believe COP will have issues with retention once people begin retiring. I also don't agree with the way salaries are handled. You are basically awarded raises off your years of employment and not the workload you take on.

The company has 9/80s, which means some people get every other Friday off (but not everybody).
";"It's an uninspired place to work. Nobody loves their job at ConocoPhillips.There are lots of bureaucrats. The company is always a few years behind in technology.

";"I got caught up in the Conoco Vs Phillps management fight for control of the company that occurred in 2002-2012. How this happened was all of the top jobs went to the Phillipss guys, as truly as everyone knows , Phillips took over Conoco and not vica versa. The name of the company was a last minute deal that Phillips management agreed to get controil of the company. Unfortunatly, while the top layer was Phillips personnel, the next layer was alll Conoco Personnel. So if you were in that 3rd tier level and you were a Phillips guy, you might as well forget, once 55 came around, you would not get any salary increases as was told to me separately and if they could think of any reason, you were terminated at age 55 or as soon after..I can provide 15-25 names who left at 55,of who i knew.

2013-01-27;Analyst;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Analyst;"This company values work/life balance, has decent salaries and benefits, and is general not a bad place to work, especially if you are early in your career. If you pursue them and have great support from you manager and other people through networking, there are many doors available for advancement. This could mean leaving your current role and getting out of your comfort zone; but they are willing to train you if you show the aptitude and desire.
";"It seems some of the processes and procedures are dated, as if they are behind in the technology world we are in now. However, they are taking steps to improve this. Also, as probably in most locations, there is the good old boy mentality in some of the older leaders, as they continue to advance people based on other qualities not related to job performance.
"
2013-02-02;N/A;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Experience has been ok, nothing special;"- New CEO Ryan Lance seems like he cares more for his employees than Mulva did. (example: he did away with Mulva's joke of a forced rankings system) (example: he recently raised the bonus target rate for certain salary grades.) - Good retirement (although not as good as Devon's) and health benefits/insurance. - 19/30 days (work an extra 30 minutes each day and get one day off a month & doesn't count against vacation days) - Good work/life balance
";"- The leadership in my department once told me that we do not make counteroffers to employees that have received a better offer for another company. Seems pretty foolish - Average raises usually are around 3.5 - 4.0 percent (can be more depending on rating) - Some departments like to ""spread the wealth"" so they will alter who gets the 1 and 2 ratings each year. For example, if you get a promotion in 2012, you would automatically get the standard 3 rating that year. It is very rare to get a 1 or 2 rating two years in a row even if you do the best work. - HR has just as much of a say as your supervisor/director does on when you get promoted. - Promotions are just 6%. I know for a fact that this is not the case at CHK or Devon. - We don't find the oil, we just follow everybody else to it.

2012-03-20;N/A;Current Employee;Mediocre place for a career;"At ConocoPhillips, in most work groups the work/life balance is pretty good: if you need time off for vacation or if you are sick, supervisors are usually very understanding. The benefits (health, vision, perscription) are very good and there is a big push toward over-all wellness (physical, mental). Very nice gym facility at the main complex and a lot of outside programs to get involved in. (Rodeo Run, United Way, Employee Networks)
";"There are many layers of management at ConocoPhillips and that makes it extremely hard to get any work done or to feel any sense of ownership of a role. While it is possible to get a new role and develop professionally at ConocoPhillips, there are a lot of politics at play and there are Talent Management Teams (TMT's) that play a huge role in placing employees in new roles that are not always in the employees best interest and development, it's usually for the benefit of the company. Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees. Most of the poor treatment of employees comes from top management and employees are seen as very expendable.

The upcoming split (into two separate companies) appears to be driven by the desire to create one rather lucrative company and one company designed to absorb all of the negative feedback from the press and the EPA. This is great for stockholders but about half of the company employees will take a difficult turn as a result. These reasons appear self-absorbed and reflect a cut-throat attitude.

";"It is a gas station- you have to have the right personality to work at a gas station. There are certain people who can do it, and others who try and fail. Company sold 72 retail stores to horrible ""mom and pop"" company in Denver called PCF Saleco, LLC. Stores are now being run into the ground and not maintaining the ConocoPhillips name. Maintenanace issues at stores. Employee issues at stores. No loss prevention in place. No raises in years for managers. No raises for employees past 90 days. No bonuses.

2012-01-06;Intern;Former Employee;Very bureaucratic and not diverse;"Good pay. Intern program is alright. Could've been much better, but the Finance and IT interns had it much better since they had a good HR manager. You get to meet a lot of people through Lunch n Learns. The problem is, the interns started separating a bit, with the finance group hanging with themselves, procurement with themselves, etc. Yet there were a fair number of interns who organized and attended social events outside of work hours.
";"Bartlesville is not very exciting. Corporate bureaucracy is very very evident. VP of HR even said something along the lines of: ""you'll be promoted based on how you are perceived...."" COP barely hires outside of Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Texas. So if you're coming from the north or anywhere else, you'll be alone. For any prospective interns out there, this may all change after I write this because of the split. But I doubt there's going to be any culture changes. It's probably going to be the same boring corporate company like any other.

2011-06-11;Analyst;Current Employee;Ageing Oil Company Offers Great Pay, Limited Job Satisfaction;"Above market salaries. Low performance expectations. Little or no overtime required. Gold plated benefits. Some prestige working for a Major Oil Company.
";"The Bartlesville, Oklahoma office houses a sprawling bureaucracy which administers the IT, Finance, and Accounting functions. The culture is extremely risk-averse. The Orwellian office-safety campaign reflects an unwillingness to quantify risk, rather than a sincere commitment to worker safety. The computer systems line employees interface with are 10-20 years out of date. The staffing model, driven by seniority and cronyism, promotes uneducated legacy employees beyond their level of competence. The Tone at the Top, both in corporate management and business unit management, is focused on control, constricting employee autonomy and stifling innovation. Decision making is paralyzed by fear of risk. While the pay is above market, the opportunities are decidedly limited. Any college finance course will teach you that an option is worth money. ConocoPhillips knows this, and pays employees a premium for the options they forgo due to the remote work location and glacial pace of promotions.

2010-12-16;Software Developer;Current Employee;Relatively easy-going work environment, but unclear career path for software developers;"A relatively generous benefits package that includes company matched contributions plus an semiannual contributions of company stock (alot) that you can immediately transfer to any other fund vanguard has. An annual bonus that usually averages around 8% (also depends on company performance) of your gross annual salary, you get your own office, state-of-the-art gym and soccer field with various exercise classes available for free to employees and family, flexible schedule, tuition reimbursement (90%), good work life balance (at least for software guys)
";"Groups vary widely from each other and can have managers that are real slave drivers. Luckily, I'm not in one of those groups, but I have heard that for some groups Saturday is just another work day. ConocoPhillips likes to stick with older software platforms and has yet to take the leap to current technologies like GPGPU or even web services. It appears that software we end up supporting/developing has more to do with the person who yells the loudest, rather than what is truly useful or innovative. But, as long as you swim with the current, you'll be fine. Also, the career path for software developers isn't clear at ConocoPhillips, but who cares when you get a sweet benefits package.

2010-09-10;N/A;Former Employee;Great Company For Stockholders, Not So Much For Employees;"The company does a great job of providing knowledge sharing between business units and refineries. It has an ample supply of industry leading subject matter experts. The company's size allows it to offer a wide variety of geographical different places to work.
";"The management culture at the refinery is regressive with regards to treating employees as real people. If business goals can only be met by overworking their subordinates, this is much more likely to happen than communicating negative news up the chain of command. High level management makes decisions on benefits and HR issues from a strict accounting perspective.

Good pay and great benefits compared to other industries. Relatively secure compared to more cut throat industries. If you are the kind of person who just wants to coast until retirement with decent pay and benefits this may be the place.
";"Job satisfaction is quite low. How people are promoted and rewarded is extremely political. You are rewarded more for conforming to the status quo than being innovative and using your abilities. Lots of wasted talent exists at this company and the seemingly endless supply of poor managers will never extract it. I would not waste too much time here if you really want to do more with your life and feel you have given and achieved your full potential.

Cafeterias at other locations are lacking.
";"Pay is below the industry average Career and compensation development is slow and celebrates mediocrity while discouraging exceptional performance Benefits are reduced each year Short term success, at the expense of long term development and stability, are celebrated and rewarded Promises of promotion are offered in order to encourage employees to transfer to different positions and cities.....these promises are generally broken after the fact Human Resources staff refuses to address employee issues....they won't even return phone calls for up to a month and that's if you contact them daily and complain to their management

I was an employee for 29 years in locations through out the U.S. and was able to work with some of the finest and most talented people in the industry! I feel lucky to have had the chance to work with all of them!
";"Management has changed the company to the point that the people on the ground are now working under the most unfavorable conditions I have ever seen. The employees are in constant fear of reprisals if some thing goes wrong even if it isn't there fault. Management views seem to be blame the people for things that happen as the reason and not their decision to eliminate projects to cut the budget that could have prevented things from going wrong.
"
2010-03-10;N/A;Former Employee;If you want the opposite of pay for performance, look no further......;"Great severance package, great outplacement.
";"Be aware that when your supervisor puts your name in for promotion that he/she might come back with a pink slip. From what I've seen its better to spend time on Facebook or chewing out peers than to perform. In fact, if you've had exceptionally poor performance, it takes 6 - 12 months for you to get fired. If you're a great performer, they just lay you off and call it a reduction in force.

2010-01-28;Geologist;Current Employee;A pretty good place to work with really good people;"Overall, excellent people in the geosciences community at COP. Not a ""shark tank"". Real team interactions. This is a place you can make friends.
";"Mid-level management seems out to lunch. Weird decisions, changing their minds and taking back things put forward very recently. Some very odd people in high level technical management positions. A sense that relationships will get you a lot further at COP than technical competence.

";"I worked in Ponca City for 7 years until the merger when projects were shut down (even though Conoco's R&D was more efficient than Phillip's). I was transferred to Houston where I moved from downstream to upstream. I later found out I was brought in 2 pay grades lower than a man with the same experience & background but I was just happy to have a job after the layoffs. No room for growth - couldn't change engineering disciplines. Bonuses got smaller after the merger.

"
2009-10-18;N/A;Current Employee;Great Place to Work;"Knowledge sharing is common, which makes it is a great place to learn from more experienced colleagues. People are friendly and open. There are lots of opportunities within the company because of its size, but it is not overly bureaucratic as some large organizations become. Large company opportunities with small company values.
";"Career path options are not always clear (however, the same is true at many companies). Team relationships could be strengthened if management and team members changed jobs less frequently. Some aspects of strategy and people development/discipline seem a bit outmoded.

With such a large company, there are a lot of diverse opportunities and functions you could work in to build a cross-functional expertise - or an area expertise.
";"Work life balance could get out of balance quickly if you move up in the organization. They could pay more competitively in terms of a base salary and especially with salary increases. The career progression tended to be slow, simply because of size.
"
2009-09-16;N/A;Former Employee;Review of ConocoPhillips;"Really talked up work/balance to compensate for average remuneration. Early career females lapped this up and some practically begged for us to offer them a job, even when jobs were plentiful.
";"Sometime after the merger, it got to where getting results no longer matter Engineering style management control. Little empowerment exists. Poor transparency from supervisory management. Management so wrapped up in execution that they lack of vision to see business landscape. Herd mentality. Low appetite for risk. Over levaged (too much debt). Deal taker, not a deal maker.
"
2009-07-18;N/A;Current Employee;Review...;"Huge opportunity to explore and learn about energy markets and how they are traded Traders here are true experts and most are willing to help.
";"If trading is your goal, it can take a serious time investment to become one at COP (think 5+ years out of school). The company likes to build traders up in their mold and are in no rush to have you do so (the one exception may be with the power traders where you start off as either a scheduler or 24-hour trader).
"
2009-07-15;N/A;Current Employee;Terrible Work Culture;"It is a Job for now
";"Management by fear and intimidation.Very poor culture to work in. In all my years with this company I have never seen the morale so low.

2009-05-29;N/A;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips - Challenging and rewarding Refinery Engineering positions;"Challenging opportunities and a dynamic work environment keep the job interesting and always changing. Also, teamwork is required but is very rewarding as well.
";"Working in a 24/7 operation calls for being on call some nights and weekends and can hamper plans you had when things go wrong at the plant.

2009-04-24;Intern;Current Employee;Intern loves job;"Good benefits, flextime, great pay, and the people are all very easy to get along with. It is definitely a place you will love or hate. Everyone that I came in contact with treated me as a coworker and not as in intern. I was also given a real task, which was a big deal to me. I did not want to get coffee for people are summer long, regardless of pay. Conoco puts a strong emphasis on not encroaching into your personal time, so you don't have to worry about working at home.
";"No outstanding downsides that you don't find everywhere else. Some people may not like the social atmosphere, but that is fine.
"
2009-04-28;Analyst;Current Employee;Not for everybody, but could be worse.;"Access to great training opportunities, co-workers are very sharp and a pleasure to work with.
";"Managemnt across the board seems fairly archaic in their management philosophy. It becomes very apparent that you're living in a ""Phillips"" world after a few short months.
"
2009-04-02;N/A;Current Employee;Experience at ConocoPhillips;"The people at ConocoPhillips are very friendly and willing to help others out. They offer a lot of opportunities to individuals that are just coming out of college. There are many ways to learn more about the industry and see whether or not it is a good fit. ConocoPhillips also has great compensation and everyone seems to be very excited to work there. You are constantly challenged to apply everything you have learned into your work and have the guidance of the other employees. Overall, I would definitely recommend individuals to look at this company and consider it as an option.
";"There are not many downsides to working at ConocoPhillips. The only thing I can think of is the fact that the headquarters are located in Texas, which is not my ideal location to work at. I also think that the company is pretty big so it may feel like you can get lost, but as long as you take the initiative to suceed and ask questions, the size of the company won't really get to you. ConocoPhillips offers a lot to its employees and it is up to the individual to pave their own path and create their own experience.
"
2009-03-25;Stillman;Current Employee;Not great but I wouldn't change.;"Pay is pretty good compaired to other companies. The work is reasonable for the pay and they offer the normal package of incentives, health insurance, 401K etc. Like the military there is two groups, officers and enlisted or hourerly and salary. Most of the time it seems we work against each other all the while promoting team work. All of the hourly work in a very tight team work organization but are often interupted by management (salaried) to do some bonehead idea. Unfortunately there is no oversight on them so no matter how bad they mess up they keep their job. Hourly not so much, mess up too much and your gone.
";"Your just a number, not treated as a person.

";"Management can't seem to root out the weeds. The wrong people are promoted and aren't held accountable for bad behaviors and inaction. The company needs to take a good long look at how employees are treated and how they are not being satisfied.
"
2009-02-20;Employee;Current Employee;Fair Compensation?;"Job Security is great. Work is satisfying.
";"To sign a contract with the labor unions with a 3% increase and $2500 signing bonus and then freeze salary increases for non-union is absolutely horrid. Nothing like a kick in the teeth for those of us on the salary side. As far as severences go, there are more than 4% of the workforce that have very little contribution to the quality of the company. In our facility alone, I could easily point out 20% that we could do without and still get by.
"
2009-02-18;N/A;Current Employee;Senior Management takes MILLIONS in VCIP payouts while laying off hundreds of employees.;"It's a horrid economy, so it's great to have a job
";"Individuals are unable to control their own career. Senior Mgmt participates and waists nearly 2 months of the year in ""people planning"" activities trying to direct the careers of their reports. Sadly, positions that are posted have already been spoken for by the Senior Mgmt team. This is contrary to the actual communication to the employee which says that they are to take charge and own their career by filling out their Individual Development Plan and post for positions that make sense. Sadly, employees with appropriate skill sets are passed over because they didn't graduate from the right University Graduate program
"
2009-02-17;Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips - A Good Company with Potential To Be Great!;"It is a large reputable company which is more stable than many of the smaller independents oil and gas companies
";"Upper management is from financial side of the business and are therefore more interested in stock price than in long term sustainability. They continuously cut corners to improve the bottom line without regard to the long term effects. Similarly, like most other majors, they are not being proactive in transitioning from an oil/gas company into a energy company that includes renewables. Most of their alternative energy work is fundamentally based on hydrocarbons. There is also a significant dissention between the heritage Conoco and heritage Phillips employees. This feud has been the basis for many poor decisions that have been made in the past.

2008-11-27;Process Engineer;Current Employee;Come to ConocoPhillips;"It is a good time to start your career with COP. There is a large population that is nearing retirement so there will be plenty of opportunities for career advancement. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are generally pretty good too. There is no shortage of work, so if you like to be busy then you should look at this company. There are a lot of highly skilled folks that generally like to engage the younger workforce and assist in their development - which is a big plus. There is also a lot of construction activity going on at my site so you can be pretty confident about career longevity and job security.
";"I'm sure there are any.
"
2008-12-08;Financial Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips, a large company with its ups and downs.;"ConocoPhillips has good benefits and total compensation. They have a 19/30 program where if you work an extra 30 minutes a day, you can take 1 free comp day off a month. This adds 12 paid days a year to the already generous vacation package. ConocoPhillips has on-site, top-notch fitness facilities free of charge to employees. They have a lot of opportunities.
";"Since ConocoPhillips is such a large company, it is easy to be overlooked. There are so many people, it is sometimes difficult to feel like you are actually making a difference and contributing to something. It is very difficult to get involved/interact with upper management. It seems like there is a lot of red tape to go through.
"
2008-11-05;Analyst;Current Employee;Jim Mulva is an amazing leader;"The Houston complex is being renovated and is very nice. The fitness center is world class! The credit union is on site and very convenient. Excellent employer for people early in their careers as there is a great deal of focus on developing young talent.
";"Many locations are undesirable. The move to a open, 'pod' work environment is a negative - very difficult to focus on work while listining to the conversations of others. Experience is not always valued.
"
2008-10-17;Senior Engineering Technician;Current Employee;A good company to start out at.;"OK pay & benefits - most of the managers I've had have been easy to get along with
";"OK pay & benefits - you can go to just about any independant and get better pay. Mulva takes his $50 million but certainly isn't spreading it around any. A lot of my peers (in other companies) have been getting 30%+ bonuses while COP was giving 7-14%. Recently a 20% retention bonus was given to some engineers in some BU's and not others and a 5% raise given to US based employees but not to expats.

2008-09-24;Intern;Former Employee;Good company, good pay, great benefits, nice people.;"Good benefits package, very nice people and comfortable office.
";"From what I have heard, career advancement may be more subjective depending on how well you fit in to the culture instead of being based more on individual performance.
"
2008-09-21;Analyst;Current Employee;great company overall;"Great benefits, higher than average remuneration, leadership is generally accessible in the lower cadres, but become less so higher up in the organization. access to a worldwide workforce and experience from experts in several countries. very high levels of job security,
";"lots of process, decision making can be slow. Sometimes tasks are divided among many resulting in less than optimal levels of challenge
"
2008-08-21;Scheduler;Former Employee;"Look at where he has taken the company over the past 10 years. From an ""also ran"" to a major";"Good asset portfolio, nice campus, great wellness center, nice people to work for and with
";"HQ is based in Houston, Texas and the other main US employment center is in Bartlesville, Oklahoma
"
2008-08-21;Finance and Accounting Director/Manager;Current Employee;The Best Oil Major in the Industry--Publicly held at least.;"Great focus as a company. We are all pulling in the same direction. I feel that we are providing quality products, providing energy for our country in a very responsible manner. I could not be more proud of a more ethical company.
";"For me there probably are no more advancements due to age (over 50). Our focus is on the young as it should be--however I'm afraid we have lost sight of our best experience. We have a huge disconnect between the generations. Our industry suffered greatly in the 80's and 90's so we really have a great number of folks too young and inexperienced to take the reins from us in management.
"
2008-08-20;Analyst;Current Employee;Happy to be at COP;"Dynamic energy company with lots of growth opportunities. It seems like there are always new jobs posted on the internal web site. Headquarters in an easy-to-get-to Houston location, not in downtown. Benefits are fair, especially when it comes to retirement and savings -- pension, 401k and stock thrift are hard to beat. Salaries may be slightly lower than average.
";"The ""old-timers"" talk about the differences between Conoco and Phillips. This is sometimes disheartening to hear, especially when you hear of the frequency of rewards for a job well done in the old days. Recognition and performance feedback seem to be lacking. Probably true for most companies though with the litigious society we live in.
"
2008-08-17;Analyst;Current Employee;ConocoPhillips is a great safe place to work for both family oriented and non-family oriented people.;"The people at ConocoPhillips are great to work with. You don't feel like you're just a number. At most companies, you feel like there are revolving doors with people constantly leaving, but that is not the case here. If you're in the finance or most other aspects of the company, you don't have to live in the ""big"" city for your ""big break."" There are plenty opportunities right here in Bartlesville and it's a good place to raise children and have a family. Higher ranking officers from the corporate office even drop by to your office from time to time and come to each person's individual desk to talk to you to get feedback. On top of all that, the company has GREAT PAY and WONDERFUL BENEFITS. The company is always looking for more ways to improve and satisfy its employees. So far, it has been a great company to work for.
";"I have not experienced any downsides yet since I've been with the company and I don't expect to experience any. I've enjoyed everyday at work and the jobs are challenging, but not too challenging to the point where they can't be completed.
"
2008-08-16;Reservoir Engineer;Current Employee;the integrated oil and gas company of choice;"diverse workforce, interesting projects option for international transfers. the company started a grad program which offers engineers the choice to rotate disciplines for the 1st 2 years. wellness and health initiatives actively promoted including gyms, massages. onsite cafeteria, gym and swimming pool. extensive raining opportunities alliance with petroskills
";"no growth in the lower 48 too conservative with salary, interdeprtmental transfers difficult, too stig with education rembursement
"
2008-07-26;Analyst;Current Employee;Go COP;"Compensation is good. Locations around the world. Some chance for advancement. Company is making lots of money - as long as the government keeps their hands out of it. Lots of good people. If you are a hard worker you will be compensated well. If you are an average worker you will still be overpaid. If you're a louzy worker they will keep you around anyway. Once your on the payroll it is hard to get rid of people. Have some good locations to work at. Big city (Houston) or smaller towns (Farmington NM). Great variety. Bigger office have good work out facilities.
";"Understaffed - Understaffed - Understaffed. Get locked in to a job you are good at. And suddenly no more chances for advancement. Got to wonder were middle managment comes up with some of their ideas. Can be cases of the ""buddy system"" at work. Company catering to the new hires - making what appears to be unrealistic expectations for each and every one fo the new hires. At the same time telling the old guys (that do most of the work) that we've got to work smarter not harder. Sometimes they penny pinch and don't give the tools that are needed to do the job. But the biggest thing is that 10% of the people do 90% of the work.
"
2008-06-11;Senior Software Engineer;Current Employee;A Leader in the Industry;"Leader in the industry. Great opportunity for professional development. The Employee morale is great probably because of record oil prices. ConocoPhillips does a terrific job of incenting employees though stock incentives. The leadership is second to none and the opportunity is great as long as you are willing to be flexible geographically
";"Much is expected. Many hours are required. In order to advance you need to be flexible geographically. Many of the places where oil is located is inhospitable, but you know that going in.
"
2008-06-12;Operations Engineer;Current Employee;Wood River Refinery pays well, but fails to have a good work-life balance for its employees.;"The high salary, the chance to make changes that have a lot of monetary value.
";"The lack of work/life balance. I worked 45 days straight of 10-12 hour days and only got 5 days of comp time. However, getting any comp time is atypical. Typically no comp time is given for having to work late or on weekends. The lack of business sense is frustrating. We spend a lot of time trying to save money and do the bare minimum to fix the problem. Then shortly thereafter we have to spend twice the money and time to reapply the band aid. Then we go on to the next fire to fight.
"
2008-06-11;Technical Service Engineer;Current Employee;Working here has pluses and minuses;"You have the opportunity to take your career in many different directions. (Jobs are posted internally, but like most job-hunting networking is important.) Most people seem to have a good work-life balance. There is a lot of talk about alternative energy and developing new technology, which is exciting.
";"The work processes are pretty weak (relative to an ExxonMobil, for example). This allows flexibility, but also causes a lot of confusion about how to get things done and what goals are most important. Senior managers are strong, but middle management is decidedly lacking. People follow seemingly random career paths and frequntly do not have the skills and knowledge they need to manage the group below them very effectively.

2017-09-08;Reservoir Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Good company, interesting work, good pay;"There is a very high percentage of good honest people working here. Thankfully there are not very many a**holes and that attitude is generally not tolerated. There are good holidays, good pay (though now stagnated). The hours have certainly become longer since they halved the workforce. But there are rarely people shouting at you to get stuff down. Relaxed working environment. If you were married with a mortgage and modest ambitions, this would be a good place to while away the years.
";"Compared to their peers, they don't really care about being technical. Which means they don't really care about training their people or advancing their knowledge. As long as the oil and gas keeps coming out of the ground and the share price doesn't plummet its all yippee ki-yay mother..... Since the downturn in oil price, the company is just doing really boring work, which keeps the investors happy but the employees less so. The result of this means that many good and ambitious people are not motivated to stay with the company long term as there is no reward. Its all stick, no carrot.
"
2017-09-14;Anonymous;Former Employee;Director, Continuous Improvement;"Large, multi national company. Great assets.
";"Too much debt, leadership is having difficulty leading through the challenges faced by the oil business. Has made some incredibly bad decisions.
"
2017-08-22;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Great company - massive changes in 2017 may be detrimental;"Great benefits, good policies for benefits and employee treatment. When oil price is good, this is a great place to work.
";"2017 changes brought many ex-pats to leadership and a (needed) refocus on cost. Business needed it but very stressful on employees and even with the salaries and bonus...is it worth it? Main problem is oil / gas price. Tough times.

2017-08-26;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Poorly organized company and leadership team;"- Benefits - Surmont camp was a good place to live considering being on a fly in and out - Fly in and out schedule
";"- Relies on a buddy system to get hired which reflects in the individuals they have working there. - Extremely disorganized, general lack of direction in terms of work scopes and priorities. - Entire management team is either an operator or has a 2 year tech degree which is reflective in the general lack of technical knowledge and logical thinking. - Conoco is basically like flipping burgers - need the job to collect money but other then that don't bet on building a career here.

";"Company is laying off employees, selling assets, and unable to address mismanagement. Big company policies in a shrinking company. Strategy is floundering. Firing employees but keeping contractors, suggesting that future changes are coming. Appears they will continue to sell assets in US dry gas and Canada. Lacking true leadership. Many surviving employees now actively job searching.

Company values are sound, Safety and Environmental, they do take it serious and mean it when they say there is nothing so urgent it can't be done safely.
";"May be too many managers and leads and not enough workers. As the company grew and shrank, it seemed like there were more and more middle management positions appearing, Maybe we should have forced some of the ""Managers"" to go back to being workers when the layoffs were on the go.

";"It is an US company so focus in not in Canada. Management boasts good work/life balance but then they have no consideration for outside work hours when it comes to IT staff. You are just suppose to be available regardless of the schedule.
