2021-08-31;Senior Project Manager;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Pretty Good Place to Work;"Most people are knowledgeable and easy to get along with. 6% 401K salary match and another 4% on top of that for a total 10% match. Decent salaries and bonuses. Stock discount program. Free gym for downtown employees. Not too much bureaucracy compared to other places I've worked.
";"Limited upward mobility, and sometimes operations personnel are difficult to deal with. Management is overly conservative with things like working from home/and remote (they explicitly said they will not be doing this).
"
2021-09-29;Accountant;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Great benefits but be prepared for a lot of work!;"Pay is good and benefits are second to none. Health insurance costs less with twice the coverage of my previous employer. Heavily subsidized parking or free bus passes for commuters.
";"Old school O&G mindset in management. Expect long hours and no flex time or work from home opportunities here. Also, PTO is mediocre at best.

2021-08-22;EHST;Current Employee;Compliance Issues, Zero Flexibility, Bad Handling of Covid;"Many employees are disappointed in the company and leaving so there should be job openings listed soon. Good pay is the only reason to be here. Other departments at this company may have acceptable working conditions but the EHST Department has serious issues both in the field and corporate offices.
";"Widespread compliance issues and failing infrastructure that are severe enough to undermine the company's long term sustainability and stock prices. Understaffed and overworked. Zero flexibility (no flex time, no comp time, no work from home, no alternative schedule). If you are sick and have to take leave they still expect you to work at home while you are gone. Since they don't allow working from home, you will be expected to take PTO and work from home while sick. Hard work is rewarded with more work, not advancement. No support for employees with covid, or for employees with family members with covid.

2021-08-25;Measurement Automation Technician;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Deceiving and dangerous management;"Lots of different challenges, out of town projects and assignments.
";"Everything else. Spend over a week out of town jumping thru hoops to make a project work out because a project manager dropped the ball? Yep, you'll be told to do that. Leave town often to finalize, perform electrical inspections, program RTUS, coordinate and lead contractors, then finally perform point to point checkouts and report daily? Yep you'll be told to do that. Even tho an electrical inspector is sleeping in his damn truck, you'll need to do that because none cares. Inspect all pneumatic tubing, reverse engineer faulty designs, set up control valves, both gas and liquid with NO TRAINING!!! It had better work, or it's your but t. Do multiple tasks with liability on you, with little to no support from ""management"" and you'll probably fail. Then you will be fired. They are required to provide you with ppe. After two years, never received my electrical gloves. Got tired of asking. At first, they cost too much money. Then they forgot. This department is a disaster you will REGRET. they have zero leadership and are 100% looking out for thier golden ladder. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!. Can't believe I left a decent job at p 66 for this sham. I wanna go back to my I&E job. Enterprise is all about the$$$$$$$$$$$ to those up top. Everyone else is disposable. No bonuses for anyone other than the salaried, they brag about record quarterly earnings, you might get a 2.5% ""cost of living adjustment"" if you're lucky. There is no end of year review process, and the departments can do that if they want, however they want, or not at all. You're kept in the dark on most everything, and really are not a part of a workgroup. Required training (CPR, fire extinguisher, etc...) needs to be scheduled by you, and kept up with by you, and if they need you out of town you'll need to reschedule. This often leads to being out of compliance on these, and.... its ON YOU! A culture of fear is how they run the company, every policy has the term ""up to and including termination"" for a reason. I never had one single infraction and was fired out of nowhere. Just don't work here

2020-12-28;Manager;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Beware;"Many good people with a high level of professionalism work there, but that can be found in any company this size. The benefits are good.
";"Cronyism and nepotism are rampant. The leadership is weak and stingy. There are NO policies that would protect employees from unscrupulous management. No trust in nor regard for employees that I could see and I was there for several years. The starting pay is high for the area but below their competitors so the best talent goes elsewhere. Raises are small for the average employee so if you accept a position here I would recommend negotiating the highest starting wage possible, get a few years of experience in the industry, and get out. Several departments have this kind of revolving door with a 1-2 year turnaround. Money seems to be the only thing management cares about, and they make lots of it, but it does NOT trickle very far down from the top.

2020-08-20;Anonymous;Current Employee;Good place to work, except during Covid;"Good team environment, good pay and benefits
";"Since July, it’s 100% back in the office with zero allowance for work from home. See other reviews about old school culture, that’s coming back in the form of the company actively opposing any accommodation for work from home, even if you have kids in virtual schooling. Masks are required at all times in the office (good) but other than that they’re pretending it’s business as usual. Management stresses “personal responsibility” and not coming to work if sick at all, but it costs vacation time if you call in sick. The incentives and the message don’t line up.

";"I’ve read some of the reviews and I agree with several comments. There is a lack of consistency for internal processes in some of the departments, as well as, a lack of communication. The company is trying to address these areas of improvement like many other companies. Sadly, there are many underqualified, poor performing, and underperforming employees in the company that are getting compensated for trying to “look busy” in a slow market. These employees are taking advantage of the situation. The company needs to trim the fat. The high performers even in a slow market continue to outshine these individuals; it’s easier to “see” who needs to be cut and it’s time to take care of business in our cost-savings environment.

2019-02-28;Senior Accountant;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Each team has their own culture;"Great culture in certain groups. No micro managing & work life balance good... disclaimer - it has everything to do with the team you work for. Strong company, lots of intelligent & kind people.
";"No real appreciation for employees from upper management & no defined path to growth.

2016-06-23;Scheduler;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Scheduler;"Let's get real. YES, Enterprise is a giant corporation. YES, sometimes the corporate office is a meat grinder. YES, sometimes management is hard on you. YES, there are communications breakdowns across groups...blah blah blah. But let's get real, what major corporation doesn't have these issues?? You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb. Cliché or not, that's what I've experienced, and there's my two cents.
";"The downtown commute from the north west side sucks, but hey, that's not really Enterprise's fault is it...

";"Below average pay raises. No promotion unless old people retire. Younger talent is overlooked. In order to move up you need to sit in that chair for years. Managers don't know the work employee puts in.

2015-03-01;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Not what it used to be. Sadly.;"For the first 3 years I RAVED about working for this company. I've been in my profession for nearly 40 years and this is by far the best company I have worked for. Then Dan Duncan, the founder, died and the sharks took over. Dan started out as a truck driver and built a multi billion dollar enterprise but he never forgot what it meant to take care of the workers. I still love my job after seven years. Excellent pay and benefits. Depends on your location and department as to how well you will be treated.
";"As eluded to in the Pros section, this company has lost sight of it's employees and has a single focus on it's shareholders. Enterprise, to it's credit continues to make record earnings each quarter but it is also constantly taking away things from the employees. The company has lost a great number of its employees over just the past 4 years because it no longer appears to care for its people. This is a ""perception paranoid"" driven company. Common sense seems to have gone out the window for fear of an unfavorable perception of everything from peers to managers to the public. Depending on your department, you may or may not love this company. My department is a quagmire of paranoia and backstabbing.

2014-02-11;Pipeline Controller;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Pipeline Controller;"They pay good for your experience. Good benefits. Some good people to work for if you get the right manager and team mates. Good schedule and you get almost all of your days off. I would recommend a friend to get training to go elsewhere.
";"Prompt the wrong people, if you're not a suck a** forget it even though you have more knowledge and may be better for the job. Management lacks direction. Managers are puppets for the upper management. They PREACH safety but all management cares about is the bottom dollar and how much money is made at all cost. There's a sever lack of professionalism. No bonuses or sick time. You work under a microscope and everyone wants to place blame elsewhere. It's constant CYA. You are a robot and better not make a mistake. Large control room and have lost the TEAM atmosphere. People will step on you to get ahead and try to make you look bad to better themselves. Management lets you know you're just a pee'on and there's constant micro-management and braidment from Management. Management blows the smallest things out of proportion and lets everyone know about it. Over worked and now one cares. High turnover rate. If you want good pay and benefits you have to put up with way to much politics, but that comes with the large setting of the conrtol room. There is a clear divide among control groups. I would take less money for less headache and BS.

2012-08-19;Engineering Development Rotational Program;Current Employee, more than 3 years;EDRP Year Three;"The program has grown significantly and there has been more executive support of the rotational program as a whole. The third year focuses on Project Management and as a third year EDRP I have a project portfolio of around $9MM. This leads me to believe that they trust me with the level of responsibility required to manage small to medium projects on my own.
";"There is no clear picture about what transpires at the end of the three year program and how the transition will occur and the level of personal ""say"" in the permanent position. There tends to be some shortfalls in the mentoring capabilities across the board. There is no formal review process to assess your progress against others in the program.

2015-12-13;Supervisor;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Well run company, could pay a little better;"Management makes smart decisions and thinks strategically for the long term. Still buy their units when they go on sale. Not sure how much culture nd changed since founder Dan Duncan's death, but he kept company ethical, fair, and honest.
";"Lots of rapid acquisitions made recordkeeping and chain of title a challenge on assets. Left company for external opportunity after HR offered me 10% less for an opening than they would offer an external candidate because it would have been too large of an incremental raise for me. Yes, they literally confirmed that to me. Stupid policy, I had four years of company culture, connections and SOPs. Job hopping sends the only way to get a real raise these days. Sure worked out better for me.

2018-03-19;Anonymous;Former Employee;Bad Management Good People;"- The People - One of the best aspects of working at Enterprise was the people you interact with on a daily basis. The majority of the ""worker"" level people are smart, capable and friendly. - The Assets - Enterprise has a lot of assets that are well integrated and well run by the Operations team. This makes it much easier to do your job as a member of the team at the corporate office. - Bonuses - Once you get into the bonus pool, the LTIP and STIP are both very competitive.
";"- Management - From the VP level to Senior Management, there is a lot of incompetence and arrogance. The management team overall treats the employees of the company very poorly. They push them to work more hours and get more and more work done, but there's no appreciation for the dedication. Employees are regularly scolded or reminded that they are replaceable. - Lack of upward mobility - There is very high turnover at Enterprise, so you would think this would result in a lot of merit based promotions, but that's not the case. Promotions are regularly given based on who you are friends with rather than the work you're doing. This creates discord among the employees and puts unqualified personnel in power positions.

2014-08-26;Technician;Current Employee;Once a great place to work quickly is becoming an unbelievable nightmare of a job! Not sure how much longer I will last…;"Pay is excellent after you complete your training, although it is low to start. Vacation benefits are in line with competition, Health insurance and benefits package are pretty good. Most of the employees are wonderful to work with, company provided truck very nice to have.
";"No life/work balance in my job at all. Horrendous rude and inconsiderate management, local supervisors are not knowledgeable in any area. Company management threatens and harasses employees. Management has a never-ending dump the liability on the working man mentality. Insane crazy amount of documentation designed to cover the supervisor’s rear in case anything “Bad” happens. Claim they own you 24/7 and force you to be on call 24/7 365 days a year (yes employees were told they could even be called into work if they were on vacation days!) Supervisor forced a very devoted employee to quit and then threw a celebration because Supervisor thought the Area manager would be so pleased he did so. Employees so stressed that an unusually large percentage have left on short term disability. May have to quit this job, stress is awful!

2012-02-16;Tankerman;Current Employee;For the most part working at enterprise was a good experience.;"When I worked at Enterprise I felt they were always fair with the pay and how they treated employees. Some employees would gripe about the company but I never had any complaints with the company. They are good about getting you to the boat and getting you off the boat when it is crew change time.
";"They don't always hire the best people for the job

2013-09-04;Administrative Assistant;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Excellent opportunity to learn new things but a bit difficult to move up within company.;"Benefits,salary is okay,convenient hours, family oriented environment offering flexibility, convenient accessibility to and from parking garage to building. Opportunity to show talents and demonstrate capabilities.
";"Not everyone is a team player, there are a few employees who refuse to help others within their group and supervisors/managers refuse to address because employee has been with company for a long time.
"
2014-03-06;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Environmental;"The pay is good, however, they will expect a lot in return. Enterprise also supports additional training and allows the employees to attend seminars, even if it is out of town. Being a big company you are provided with, or have access to the latest software and hardware.
";"Understaffed. Competence is lacking, especially with the new hires.
"
2017-11-14;Analyst;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Benefits;"Benefits are a plus. Good for someone that has to visit the doctor often or that has kids. They also have low Copays.
";"Not many chances for advancement. The politics here are like nowhere I’ve ever worked before. They seem to only promote who they know and/or who they want in the position as opposed to giving others the opportunity to grow.
"
2013-09-06;Pipeline Controller;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Exceptionally Rewarding for Hard Workers;"Leadership recognizes hard workers, rewards those who improve the overall systems and compensates well those who strive to make the company the best it can be.
";"Downtown office can be political but there are lots of options. Operations in the field and in the control center do not have as many upward mobile positions and sometimes do not get as much credit as they deserve.
"
2014-08-21;Lead Recruiter;Current Employee, more than 3 years;TOP MLP in Midstream Services Industry;"Entrepreneurial environment with opportunities for advancement. Open to suggestions regarding streamlining processess and procedures. Leadership listens to new ideas. Where others are cutting back the workforce, we continue to grow in terms of $$ and footprint. Competitive benefits.
";"The company doesn't sponsor the communities where our assets are located and this would also help with branding of the company.

2015-12-26;Supervisor;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Overall good company, but could grow in areas;"Good pay. Great health insurance. Long-term incentives once you hit a certain level are nice.
";"I've read some of the other reviews and definitely agree on several points. First, unless you work in the Commercial group, there is little growth opportunity. Secondly, it's also true that the company fails to take corrective action when it comes to low, under performing or poor performing employees (which is nice for the under performing employee - but not for their colleagues. It makes for a frustrating work environment. Thirdly, there are several unwritten policies regarding position titles, how/when people get promoted or can transfer positions, etc. and each business unit seems to have it's own policies. It's very ambiguous and makes it hard for the employee who desires to grow with the company to be able to set career growth goals. There is also no mentorship (unless you're an intern) or succession planning program.

2016-08-18;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Midstream Powerhouse;"Good salary and benefits, challenging work and some opportunities for advancement. Enterprise has good senior management, and a track record of maintaining growth through strategic acquisitions and capital growth projects.
";"The current energy price collapse is affecting Enterprise revenues, and some layoffs have occurred. Very lean staffing levels in some areas, fairly high turnover, and lack of established management systems exacerbates work in some areas. Tendency to offer sacrifices if anything goes wrong, instead of identifying root causes.

2017-04-18;Plant Operator;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Worst company in the Eagle Ford Shale area.;"Good pay and benefits. Safety minded company. Awesome people out in the field. Some supervisors are really great people. Schedules are OK.
";"TOO safety minded!! Too much paperwork by one person to fill out in order to perform work and if you miss something you obviously get in trouble. Grown adults don't need to be babysat, but that's what EP wants. Put too much on the backs of the plant operators...not an operator friendly company. They expect operators to do the jobs of maintenance personnel. No bonuses. Communication between field and office personnel (mainly supervision) is horrible!
"
2013-04-15;Oil Buyer (Driver);Current Employee, less than 1 year;Good potential, abominable leadership;"Good benefits; but comparable to many here. Housing available; very important in this booming oil area.
";"The most mismanaged facility I have ever seen in my life. The only thing missing is a revolving door on the front of the building. Concerns go unaddressed. Quality people exiting left and right due to the incredibly poor managerial skills of existing management, who get an A' in reactionary management style', but an ' F' in resource utilization and leadership.
"
2017-07-20;Anonymous;Former Employee;Depends on which department you work for;"Good pay, generous bonus and stock grants, company values doing the right thing in its operations.
";"Management is entirely top-down, lower and mid-level managers are not empowered to make decisions. Job performance motivated by fear of superiors. Corporate policies on dress, vacation, work schedule, and travel are freely modified to be far more strict and punitive based on what management feels their superiors expect. Some departments are very well-run, with motivated employees advancing based on merit and enjoying a professional work environment. Other departments are run by petty dictators managing by shouting, demeaning, and coercing workers while promoting favorites regardless of ability, experience, or qualifications.

2012-03-01;N/A;Current Employee;Enterprise Products;"Great company to work for overall. They are an honest business who hire people with integrity and a good work ethics.

"
2015-02-17;Process Engineer;Former Employee, more than 5 years;It was a rollercoaster experience filled with ups and downs.;"There is no micromanaging. You're given a task and a timeframe to do it. They were generous with the PTO policy.
";"You're at the mercy of oil prices. If there's a sudden drop like in early 2015, your job may be on the line. No one has ever told me I did a bad job, but on a random day, I got laid off.

2015-09-30;Technician;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Just a paycheck;"Pay is competitive, insurance is competitive.
";"They treat their customers like crap. Employees worse. No work/life quality at all, All work No life! Been with Enterprise since they took over Texas Eastern products to this day promote the most useless incompetent people of the bunch so you have no supervisors that can help you. promotion is good ole boy system only and usually has a family tie-in through some relation to supervisor. Some areas hardly any work actually done except pencil whipping DOT inspections, Some areas supervisors are scared cause they no nothing about what you do again no help from them. Too much favoritism. You usually excel raise wise only if you are a big talker that kisses up well.
"
2014-10-06;Analyst;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Great Place to Work but Overworked and Understaffed.;"Great Pay, chances for advancement quickly, Friday's early dismissal. Heavy interaction with upper management.
";"Work Life Balance is horrible. Work a lot of hours, overworked and understaffed groups. There is an understood statement everyone chuckles about, I am not sure why its funny, ""Long Hours, overworked, understaffed groups? Welcome to Enterprise.""
"
2015-10-11;N/A;Former Employee;Small Town Company-Small Town Wages;"This company was a great place to work because it was close to home, but the supervisors weren't so great. The wages were awful! I worked there for a year and was never given my 90 day review or my 6 month review; meaning I was never given the raise I was promised!
";"No employee reviews, no raises, no benefits. If you were sick, with a doctors excuse you had to work the following Saturday, if you did not work Saturday, sick or not you lost your job. One 20 minute break in a 12 hour shift!
"
2015-10-12;N/A;Former Employee;Inbred Buddy System like no other;"Pay and benefits and it definitely was not the management. The business model is so good, that management skills can be completely lacking and the company still stays profitable.
";"From the very top, the company expects the best of you, all of the time. Screw up and you are out - unless you are one the good ole boys. Or better yet, you've got dirt on somebody. If you are part of the club, you can harass folks that you do not like, wreck company trucks, etc... Try doing things above and beyond. It won't matter. A quote from Mr Creel: ""Your paycheck is your reward"". Meanwhile, he expects his bonuses every year. All the way down to the dumbest of supervisors that can not remember anything relevant to the company's bottom line. I have heard it
"
2017-08-06;Anonymous;Current Employee;Good place to work;"Company has a lot of learning potential for anyone who is interested in the marketing and commercial side of the Oil and Gas industry.
";"There is no formal training or review criteria for new/younger employees. You learn via trial by fire and many things you are just expected to know without being taught.

2018-09-12;Accountant;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Poor Work Culture and advancement opportunities;"Great benefits with flex hours (come in early or late as long as you are within a window and get all your hours); Fully Vested after 3 years with up to 6% match on 401K and starting out with 3 weeks PTO.
";"Very political atmosphere with open workspaces and shared desks. There is no privacy and you get the feeling you are a employee number and not part of the company. Also, they do not participate in the 9/80 work schedule like most O&G Houston companies (for commuters you still have to come every Friday for 5 hours {normally longer because you never get to leave at 5 hours}).
"
2014-03-07;Anonymous;Former Employee;Mixed experience;"I worked with a lot of really smart, motivated people. The company is willing to spend money on technology (important to me since this position was in IT). Salary was at market for the job and city.
";"Many people, and the company culture as a whole, are change-resistant. It is difficult to implement new processes because so many employees have been there a long time and do not see a need to improve how things are done. Benefits were sub-par compared to the other comparable companies I've worked for (same industry, similar size).
"
2015-07-11;Terminal/Plant Operator;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Terminal/Plant Operator;"Competitive salary in the industry. Company is growing with opportunities to move into different departments. Lots of new process units being constructed.
";"Management: Isn't consistent on promoting seasoned employees. Seasoned employees have been pasted over with less experienced new hires. Standards within the company differ from each department. Too many broken and forgotten promises. ""Good 'ole boy"" system is still thriving even though the company is growing rapidly. Raises: Are given every year but are SOLELY on your past years work requirements that management set forth. If you qualify in a new job post after the yearly evaluation (April) you are required to wait till the following year to get your pay raise (many operators have left due to this).

2014-03-18;Pipeline Technician;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Total complete lack of leadership.;"The pay is competitive, benefits are competitive, and some areas I am told are nice to work in. Hourly employees are nice people.
";"Supervisors and Area Managers are Joke, Total lack of knowledge in what they supervise, No help or support to hourly employees at all, In fact a hindrance to their productivity. They are completely nuts with the amount of admin responsibilities given to the actual workers just so the supervisors and managers can go play golf everyday it doesn’t rain. Inconsistency in the way they implement their policies will drive you up the wall. Only way to advance is to cow down to the managers and give in to his every whim. Not a pleasant work atmosphere.

";"Management/supervision will listen to your advice and suggestions then ignore you and do nothing. I mentioned safety issues many times and followed the hierarchy up. I had an unusual connection with Mr. Creel, even lunched with him downtown. Finally mentioned I had some issues, how should I deal with it. He referred me to two VP's and after much anguish I went to one of them with the issues I had tried to solve with lower levels. Inside of one month many changes were made and are ongoing. Less than six months after I exposed the poor safety culture, the West Storage facility blew up. I wish I had acted sooner. After that I began to feel much pressure and less cooperation and help from the safety department. It was obvious I was on my way out. That pressure along with them putting me in unsafe situations broke my health and they would not find work for me and I was 'eased out' on LTD. I am hoping that the culture has changed for the better but from what I read on here, it doesn't sound much improved and turnover rate is worse.
