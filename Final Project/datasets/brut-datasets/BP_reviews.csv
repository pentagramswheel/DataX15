29/09/2021;Procurement performance Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Good Company;#NOM?;"-Easy to 'get lost' in the masses. Type 'A' personalities will enjoy success here. -Promotions are hard to obtain. Ceilings can come quick. Jobs are highly competitive and circumventing internal openings can be complex. Performance ratings too subjective. -Organization is too complex. Often no clear distinctions on job responsibilities between functions/businesses. -Decisions are often by 'committee' and things can take time. -Plenty of 'finger pointing' when things do not go right. -Diversity programs seem to focus on certain groups over others (even to the point where it gets highly political)

05/10/2021;ARC Advisor;Current Employee, more than 10 years;BP;"BP is a global company with international scope. There are opportunities to do many different things. In the last couple of years, the strategy at BP was changed to pursue renewables and move away from Oil. If that is your thing, enjoy.
";"BP tends to send many jobs offshore and that trend will continue. They are also moving to automate many processes. Reducing headcount is a strategy at BP. It can often feel heartless and sterile to see people who have devoted many years in service to the company to be quietly laid off. There are many who see a downward trend at BP in terms of future earnings potential given that they intend to move away from Oil. This is a concern for both investors and employees.

Strong support of diversity of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation.
";"BP favors friendliness over delivery and accountability. The management team acts as if they are smarter than everyone else. They are manipulative and do not treat people with respect. A few people do most of the work. Despite friendly appearances, they do not like Americans.

08/01/2021;Category Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Beware of BP;"The work is interesting and the coworkers are generally friendly. I was always paid on time.
";"You should be aware that BP has an official program that involves paying financial incentives to managers when diversity targets are met for women and/or Black employees. If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often.

17/01/2021;Exploration Geologist;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Recent layoffs won't be the last ... Run away if you're a geoscientist;"Pretty good work-life balance, good benefits, good severance package (for now). Lots of smart and talented people, at least where I worked. Good diversity and inclusion.
";"Recent layoffs have gutted the company, leaving it understaffed and lacking experience. The transformation to an Agile work environment means staff are deployed on projects and seem to rush to get work done during the sprints. This might lead to the 80% solution becoming the 50% solution. New CEO bernard looney has re-imagined bp by transforming it into a utility company and shrinking oil and gas production 40% by 2030, and even less by 2050. The end result is that if you're a geoscientist and want a career in oil & gas, you should see working at bp as a dead-end and start looking for a new employer. In exploration, every new discovery is another step closer to making your job redundant. Upward mobility was challenging before the reorganization, so in order to advance people were leaving exploration to go to other companies. Now, it will be even harder. The latest layoffs were done in an opaque manner.

";"Very poor management coming from London. No good idea can ever come from outside the UK. The last 10 years, every decision made has had bad repercussion on the business, workers and knowledge depletion and yet shareholders keep getting paid at the expense of workers. Higher ups are a closed club and they only promote within their restricted group. New CEO fooled everyone with his supposed ""in touch with workers"" attitude when in reality he is ruthless and is totally out of touch with reality. He spent ""Tweeting or Yammering"" instead of truly running the business (reminds me of TRUMP). Managers are promoted based on who you know and not what you accomplish. Some managers are sooooooo bad that they keep bouncing from one division to the other wrecking havoc but never get fired. In general this organization is absolutely terrible at running assets....hence everytime they sold one, the new owners made out really well and ran that assets 100% better than when it was in BP's hands. This is all due to too much red tape. I view this organization as an oil tanker that takes forever to make a turn while it's competitors are more nimble and are more like frigates. The last 10 years, BP went through 5 reorg all by reducing headcounts or selling assets. The organization is just too lean to function properly and is constantly trying to put up fires that get started because of the lack of bodies/personnel.

";"Big global company that at times is too top heavy to make decisions. Can be a large disconnect between local business units central teams (people in London and Houston don’t always know how oil and gas production works and the ramifications and effort it takes to deliver what is asked). Also BP likes to change, saying around here goes “if you don’t like something, wait two years, it’ll change.” Can’t learn from mistakes, constantly changing systems to new systems that don’t work properly, unsupported and don’t meet requirements. Have now started rolling out new enterprise systems that don’t work properly for weeks after launch and with no actual training on how they work. Employees are expected to just figure it for themselves. Lots debt and expenses from oil spill, oil price downturn and buying assets has led them to sell current assets.

";"After the Macondo disaster, they decided to hire a lot of very qualified people to fix their supplier contract problems, Supplier quality, on-time delivery, improving KPIs and other metrics of performance, etc. It was all a huge facade. At the end of the day, they ground down these highly qualified new hires with red-tape, bureaucracy, and the worst inefficiency. All they really wanted was to look good if they were audited. Not to really fix any of the structural problems that caused the Gulf of Mexico catastrophe to begin with. A lot of copy-and-paste in Excel. a lot of BS KPIs, when category managers have no access to on-time-delivery or to Quality from suppliers. They don't even approve a trip to Lousiana from Houston, for god sakes! If you want to be well paid and look the other way, this is the place for you. If you rock the boat, they will make your life a living hell and drive you out.

Vacation time relatively weak compared to competition, but management in generally flexible if there are family issues that limit your work availability. Salary is reasonable, but much better can be had in industry, new bonus structure is good (if you have a good relationship with your supervisor), disappointing otherwise. Benefits are solid. Worldwide work locations with opportunities for advancement if you toe the company line and keep your opinion to yourself.
";"Alot of processes and red tape, trumping common sense more often than not. It's often unclear who is accountable and who makes decisions with constantly shifting management priorities. Too many layers of management that are reorganized and shuffled every 12 to 18 months and regularly roll out non-value adding initiatives that create a ton of work for technical staff, get some manager a promotion, and leave unrealistic expectations for the next manager. Internal job postings are ""just for show"", new roles and promotion opportunities are largely pre-determined and based on diversity and politics rather than merit.

";"This place is teeming with incompetent employees, especially managers. BP goes out of its way to protect incompetent managers that waste the company hundreds of millions of dollars instead of sacking them. The company is very clique-y and if you're not part of the ones that managers like, even if you do your job well, the managers will make sure to get rid of you and replace you with one of their buddies. It's very dogmatic and behind the times. BP is not a leader in the industry, it's a follower. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they just keep reworking the same problem over and over with the same mindset and never find a solution to anything. Anyone that tries to challenge dogma and come up with new ideas is considered a trouble-maker and someone that rocks the boat. Management doesn't want anyone to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems, even though they say ad nauseam that they do, because God forbid that someone exposes their incompetence. All they want is complacent worker bees that keep their heads down and brown nose managers' insatiable egos. No wonder Exxon and the other majors think of BP as a joke. When this company continues to compare their performance to those of the minors instead of the majors, you know there's something seriously wrong. Instead of improving their standards, they just set the bar very low.

They also tested you and asked situational questions. It appeared as if they had good cultural values, benefits, and solid management staff.
";"I interviewed and you could tell no one laughed, spoke to one another, very tense. Even the people interviewing looked tired. I was told there was a pension but when I asked about it, no! Now the recruiter told me there was. So, is this a trick to hire people? Ask everyone the same questions to make sure you have the same answers! The benefits for health care are the same at other places. I think they have lost their value in IL.

There is a Denver vs. Houston mentality which originated from the current onshore CEO. L48 has been laying off high performers in Houston and the field, which has caused safety issues, but are hiring positions that are laughable at best like Culture Representatives and Executive Concierge in Denver. The Denver office is spending money as if L48 is an oil driven company, but it’s not. L48 is a gas driven company.

";"It's very team dependent. You can love one team, and dislike the next. Your manager really makes or breaks your experience. As with any large company it is very political and hard to get things done in a timely manner as it has to go through many different departments to get approval. A lot of the older people at the company are just completely content working 8-4 with a decent salary and good benefits and have zero sense of urgency to get anything done, so as a younger professional trying to make a name for yourself that can be extremely frustrating. No semblance of a ""culture"" whatsoever, even though you can tell management has tried very hard to get that after the oil spill.

";"The managers/owners are childish and inexperienced in managing businesses. This alone is not a total condemnation, but the fact that they treat their employees (and even family members) more like animals or machines than actual people, as well as the matter of lying about payment methods, shady business practices that involved paying me from an alternate store location (technically a different company) in order to avoid paying me overtime on nearly 50 hour weeks is definitely a condemnation. Add to that the fact that situations were often worsened considerably, instead of de-escalated, by the inclusion of the managers/owners input made me feel unsafe working there on numerous occasions. Several other employees were given anxiety attacks due to the exploits of the managers/owners, leading to the point that I was the only employee currently working for them across ALL of their stores (the rest were family members). I am scheduled to be shuttled off to a much smaller, failing store to work due to their apparent want to get me to quit, even when my car is shared between multiple people and me traveling sizable distances mean that one of us cannot get to work.

";"I interviewed and you could tell no one laughed, spoke to one another, very tense. Even the people interviewing looked tired. I was told there was a pension but when I asked about it, no! Now the recruiter told me there was. So, is this a trick to hire people? Ask everyone the same questions to make sure you have the same answers!

Add to that the fact that situations were often worsened considerably, instead of de-escalated, by the inclusion of the managers/owners input made me feel unsafe working there on numerous occasions. Several other employees were given anxiety attacks due to the exploits of the managers/owners, leading to the point that I was the only employee currently working for them across ALL of their stores (the rest were family members).

2013-10-07;Team Leader;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Not the company it once was;"BP is a large company, and tries to be one with good values. In the past BP was a company where a strong meritocracy culture prevailed. However, its strength was its weakness, which means a lack of strong business processes allowed for employee room to create as you figured things out. Some would argue this is why we had so many industrial accidents.
";"Following Macondo, it has become more of ""do the right thing for BP"" instead of ""do the right thing"" -- its a subtle but important change. Combine this with weak business processes, and you can imagine the slippery slope when less scrupulous managers acquire power. This is important to understand if you are thinking of entering an employment relationship with BP.

Hours are incredibly flexible and the manager really wants you to be successful, considering this is the first job for some high school students in the area.

They beleive in their core values, putting safety and family first., s well as giving back to the community. There is always an abundance of resources to get any job completed successfully, and always a team environment to work in, as well as a good atmosphere. Nine-Eighty work schedule.

2014-08-13;Manager;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Middle Management (Level G staff employee);"Nice buildings, campus is Eco-friendly, very convenient work locale, free parking, events for family, good pay and bonuses.
";"VERY political company, minimal respect for experienced employees joining the company, often times promotions or Senior Level Leader jobs (Level F and above) are only given to people who ""know"" the management team or who are telling the management team what they want to hear. Very British-centric for adopting ideas and valuing opinions. Americans on global teams are treated with an inferior positioning to their British colleagues. If you can accept this environment then BP is a good fit. Company is downsizing considerably due to the legal problems of the Macondo spill. Basically going to a skeleton work model for the US locations. In financial hardships right now.
"
2009-01-22;Business Analyst;Former Employee;Great place to work, be prepared to fight to stay.;"Schedule flexibility, open envirnment, williness to share new ideas.
";"Bureaucratic methods to get those new ideas in place, too many discussions and not enough action. Mirred in 'old school' operations beliefs from those who have been with the company since the amoco/ Sohio days, and believe their way is still the best way. Multiple reorganizations, about every two years. Not enough consistency in leadership staying around for mopre than a couple years in role.

2016-04-01;Petrophysicist;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Working for BP;"Great professional staff and work environment with really good benefits
";"Few opportunities to rotate and no changes in management even if they are doing bad. Portfolio is shrinking!
"
2016-11-30;N/A;Current Employee;Love it here;"Been working at BP for a little under a year now, and so far it's be a great experience. The people are great, and there appears to be a lot of opportunities for advancement.
";"I really haven't had any negative experiences personally while working here, but I've heard from my colleagues who've been at BP for a long time that things used to be even better before the oil prices tanked.
"
2011-05-14;N/A;Current Employee;Working at the refinery has been challenging and rewarding.;"The people are great and BP respects a balance between work and life. It's always about people first and production second. I'm proud to work here. I always feel supported by management and my opinions are valued.
";"Since BP is divesting it's southern California operations and we don't know who will buy the refinery, times are uncertain. Right now, we are all in a holding pattern. many things will likely change with new ownership, which is expected by the end of 2012.
"
2010-10-12;Senior Geologist;Current Employee;Very big, pretty good, under appreciated exploration staff;"BP has a top notch portfolio with one of the best records of reserves replacment. Training is excellent and consideration for flexibility in life issues is above average. The wild-cat wells are often genuinly wild-cats.
";"I think technical staff are somewhat under appreciated in that there's a strong push to reduce promotions so as not to outpace grades in downstream such as running a bunch of gas stations. It's also getting more difficult to accomplish task with increasing process to control the range of ways of doing things. This is good and bad. BP drills very few exploration wells per year (10 wildcats).
"
2015-01-25;Facilities Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Slow / bloated;"BP promotes minorities and women and has a lot of collective knowledge. People are nice at BP, but only because their jobs are ultimately too cushy. It's easy to be nice when you're jobs are fluff and you make fewer executive decisions per person.
";"Everything happens too slowly, too many processes, too much overhead, too many meetings and trying to follow the functional model just because its a corporate trend when you've become a small operator who's overstaffed is not effective.
"
2015-07-23;Anonymous;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Great Company;"BP is a great company to work with. Most boss was the greatest and he was very kind and helpful. They took me out to dinner when a was relocating from Ilinois.
";"If i could i would have worked in the day time that would have been better. I would loved to have worked more hours but that would not have been good for my health. Overall great company to work for.
"
2016-04-27;Engineer;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Great compensation & benefits, limited professional options;"BP, like many oil majors, has a very generous compensation and benefits package. Salaries are very high compared to service companies, with bonuses when commodity prices are high. Office physical environment is very nice (Fortune 100), and this large company has a large employee base from which one can learn from.
";"Politics and lack of career opportunities given current and past legal problems. Internally, the company is fractious and management undisciplined. Specifically, many company rules are followed/voided by simple fiat. Lack of management accountability has led to overemphasis on short-term gains above all else.
"
2009-04-28;Commercial Analyst;Current Employee;There are plusses and minuses to working at BP.;"BP has some great strategic thinkers who will keep the business a competitive supermajor for a long time. In general, it makes good decisions on a global scale, and has some of the best technology in the industry. It allows for flexible work hours and it truly does try to provide for a balance between personal and work life.
";"There are the management elites, and then there are the grunts. Shoving long-time employees into cubicles where there is not enough space to effectively work was just plain stupid. The company spends a huge amount of effort on ""Diversity and Inclusion"", which is fine if you think the work environment has anything to do with ""coming out of the closet"", but everybody except the white male is celebrated. It gets old.
"
2012-12-07;Process Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Great people, great benefits, lots of red tape;"Large company, lots of training opportunities, great benefits and compensation, lots of opportunity in different areas so you can move around and find your niche, lots of responsibility
";"Lots of bureaucracy makes it difficult to get things done and very inefficient, so many initiatives and changes translates into lots of work in different areas
"
2014-01-05;Senior Manager of Change Management;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Lots of interesting work but VERY bureaucratic;"- A lot of opportunity to gain experience in different countries - Very focused on providing a good employment package - Able to work on cutting edge technology and new interesting processes - Very smart people that work there
";"- Management style is very 1900's. It is very hierarchical. It was the first and only place where I heard a statement like - ""When you talk to someone at my level"" - Managers are not well trained. They are trained in BP procedures, not how to lead people - Communication to employees is awful. - There is a false focus on safety. At every meeting there was a ""safety moment"", but it was almost used as a way to avoid dealing with real issues
"
2009-02-25;Instrument and Controls Technician;Current Employee;For what it is, pretty good. Needs some improvement, but who doesn't?;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks. I appreciate the fact that even if they are truly at heart an oil company, they are taking steps to create a greener company. Overall, I am pretty happy with the company, for what it is and what industry it is in.
";"It is a big company so they have some trouble with change. You have to really work to get anyone to follow recommendations or listen to advice, but it can be done. More so than many places this one has lots of chiefs, lots of initiatives, lots of programs, and all these lead to lots of paperwork. The hire in process leaves a lot to be desired. There are many programs that the only way you find out about them is by asking your coworkers, and that is what HR expects. Sometimes it seems that the extraneous programs and initiatives are more important to management than being good at your job. The politically correct speech and business politics have taken hold of BP and sometimes you long for the “good ole days” when you could say what you mean and mean what you say. It seems that it is all about CYA (cover you’re a**), there are the expected politics and ole boy club that characterizes the oil field. Sometimes common sense takes a back seat to London or Houston’s whims. Not that they are all bad but sometimes they seem overblown, over engineered, and under thought. Sometimes the company doesn’t have the time or money to do things right the first time, but we will have it either on the second or third time though. ? I have never known any other schedule but I work offshore and my schedule is 14 days on 14 days off and 12 hour days for the 14 days that I am at work, I think that I would like to try something else. Not BP’s fault, but it is one negative about the job for me.

Definitely one of the best (if not the best) company I worked for in terms of taking care of employees. I am not sure there is anything else a company can do to take better care of people. There is constant concern about how people feel and a desire to keep people motivated.
";"A bit too process heavy and there is a lack of people willing to take accountability and ownership. I just wish this changes.
"
2017-05-24;Mechanical Engineer;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Good company to work for, with notable caveats;"Working at a refinery is never going to be a typical/relaxing 8-5 gig, but generally speaking, the work-life balance is rather good. Overall compensation is relatively on par with industry competitors.
";"Not the most popular company or industry to work in at the moment. The work-life balance I espoused in the section above is sometimes thrown out of wack. It also seems like our individual site goes through a re-organization every 3-5 years, which creates more hassle and work than anything else.
"
2009-07-06;Facilities Engineer;Current Employee;Many opportunities;"There are a large number of opportunities available to employees all over the globe. Because of these opportunities you have the ability to really pick your own career path and this means there is a career path available for all different types of people.
";"The organization is at times overwhelming and is not always focused on supporting operations as well as it should. Different parts of the organization seem to work against each other.
"
2015-03-18;N/A;Current Employee;Not the most excellent company;"A person early in their career may do well to exploit BP's passion for hiring them as relatively cheap labor. They could jump ship in a few or if they want to be a bureaucrat they could be happy staying. There can be work-life balance in some areas, and there are a few pockets of interesting work.
";"It is uninspiring and bureaucratic. Good things happen reluctantly. There is no investment, growth or innovation in people or processes. Impossible for serious people to reach their potential. Hollow rhetoric abounds. There was a widely held internal opinion that no company was more excellent than BP and amazingly managers are still acting like they believe that.
"

";"Mid-level management is too busy trying to seem relative in order to save their jobs during all of the L48 reorganization process. They will even derail careers in order to achieve their own personal goals. Although, I've been gone for over a year the VPs of the L48 assets ARE irrelevant and too busy micromanaging instead of actually doing something worthwhile.

2011-09-14;PSCM Intern;Current Employee;Great place to Intern!;"The PSCM function at BP is growing rapidly, the on the job opportunities and learning were abundant. They treat the interns to paid housing, very competitive pay, and relocation reimbursement. BP also made strong efforts to extend business travel opportunities to interns for extended and enhanced job learning.
";"Some see the new-hire Challenger program having a con in its 2, 1.5 year rotations that demand you spend 1 rotation at a field location that generally speaking is not a desirable place to spend 18 months of your younger years.

2012-10-19;Executive;Former Employee, more than 8 years;Former Retail Executive;"BP allows for its interns, employees that are hungry for advancement to take part in projects that have a large impact to the company's performance. They provide opportunity for travel, training, life time mentors, performance awards up to Global Helios including networking with thousands of employees and suppliers. Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey. In a sense, you may look back every now and then and say; “You don’t know what want till it’s gone”. I feel the lucky full time BP employees may have the last of good jobs/careers left in U.S.A.
";"Looking back in this job market. Not too many.

";"The company is risk adverse. After the Texas City and Gulf disasters, there is no appetite to operate assets due to risk exposure. The downstream business is little more than a shell of what it used to be. The company's downsized structure means there really aren't any opportunities to grow.

Myself and many other colleagues are not necessarily happy in their roles. I'm not sure if it's the stress level or the environment, but there can be quite a bit of unrest.

Very rigorous and good development program for graduates. Excellent work life balance. Highly competitive work amongst co-workers yet the working culture takes the stress out.
";"Uncompetitive bonus against other companies in the industry. Perhaps this is due to its uncertain financials resulting from the spill. Poor knowledge management system. Finding information is like looking for a needle in a haystack unless you are used to it. Process process process...it is highly complex and can stress someone out.

2015-10-23;Intern;Former Employee, less than 1 year;Cherry Point Refinery;"Cherry Point has a great work environment - relationships between all engineering groups and operations are excellent. The company highly values safety which translates to the refinery culture. The projects assigned were appropriately challenging and gave exposure to several different facets of the refinery.

Very collaborative, diverse and inclusive environment. Lots of smart people. Good work-life balance. Fairly easy to move to other parts of the company.
";"Nearly all researchers across the company were laid off in 2015. This is the second time the company has taken such a U-turn on R&D. After a decade of frivolous spending on renewable energy, the company abandoned the effort completely. There is a top-down change in strategy every few years which leads to a lot of wasted effort. The company has a serious identity crisis. In the past the company could tolerate this waste and a huge overhead because of low oil prices and few competitors. Today the national oil companies (e.g. Aramco, Petrobras) and smaller leaner companies are pretty much up to speed on oil exploration and refining. Without research and development, BP has very little to bring to the table going forward. The layoffs have also created an hourglass demography with a lot of well-connected old men and some new graduates, but very few experienced young people. With such a demographic there is very little organic change and continuous improvement - which may explain why there is a top-down reorg every few years. These reorgs always push out the middle demographic which perpetuates the problem.

During 2015, when BP was cutting over 20% of their people, I over heard HR telling someone on the phone that they could NOT let any women go.

Business Outlook
Pros
BP is an excellent place to work. Corporate values include safety, diversity, excellence, courage, and ""one team"", and every employee or contractor I have worked with adheres to these values and speaks up whenever they notice behaviors that don't reflect corporate values. I have never had a more satisfying work experience. During layoff periods, employees and contractors are given plenty of advance notice and encouraged to actively seek other employment.
Cons
Contractors often are not invited to town hall meetings, especially during the recent layoff periods. As a contractor, I had to rely on others to share what was discussed in town halls.

";"Company is in a constant state of flux and reorganization. Project Management side of the business wants to make change in culture but doesn't follow through on supporting other segments of the organization (engineering in particular). Even though there have been quite a few layoffs seems most of the folks let go were the productive people and an overwhelming amount of dead weight is still around. The company management structure is more like office space with no clear directive on a day to day which makes it tough to make progress on anything.

Overtime available to some positions. Great Diversity and Inclusion program and a very inclusive culture.
";"Due to the slump in oil prices this company has really passed along the pinch to its employees. Upper management is taking away the prized ""work life balance"" structure. and removing the option to work on 9/80 schedules. No more private offices, cramming the occupants of 2-3 buildings into 1 building and requiring everyone to be at work everyday instead of flex scheduling. Changing all offices to open concept. They took away all land lines and office telephones, all communications have moved to Skype only. Management has cut down on office perks and benefits. Janitorial services cut down. Charitable donations cut. Cafeteria food is expensive and terrible. No clear communication from management to their subordinates. No room for career growth. Personal development plans and bonuses are not based on individual performance and are not in control of your manager but based on group level performance. A lot of lay offs and cut backs and not much hope for the remaining employees. Very low morale.

";"Management is by and large incompetent (starting at the very top and trickling down to those who have to interact with the lowly plebes who actually do work) and reached their lofty positions by delivering good sales pitches as opposed to producing quality results, showing sound leadership, and having any form of business acumen.

";"BP is a poorly managed company, their safety track record speaks for itself. Though they advertise that they are focused on improving, leadership has done little to change the culture. They've been in constant ""transformation"" for the last 5-8 years. Also just recently, at least in the US they have been making it more challenging to participate in agile working arrangements. Leadership has not eliminated agile working, they have just communicated a message that does not promote it. Because they pay well senior managers tend not to leave, and most are waiting for a severance package to do so. This leads to very little long term opportunity.

Upstream BP is very good at what they do, finding energy. IT is weak and misguided but that provides opportunity for smart people to do great work. There are some great people at BP, diamonds in the rough, who can make it a great company someday if they can effect change on the culture.
";"BP management pays lip service to modern corporate values but fails to change. There are so many levels of management, most of which are clueless to what other great companies are doing and yet are closed to new ideas. Powerful internal customers routinely overrule subject matter experts to get their own way. BP calls itself collaborative but the reality is a paradox where consensus is required but everyone wants their own way effectively paralyzing any meaningful change. London lives with it's head in the clouds effectively ignoring the wants and needs to employees and leaders worldwide. Ex. 9am (GMT) global con calls are 3 am US Central time...when pressed the UK leaders will respond that the meeting can be recorded and reviewed later. Happens all the time. BP wastes more money than most companies make, which has got to be hard with the price of oil so low these days.

";"Micromanaging, soul-sucking, and discriminatory are a few words that come to mind. I was disciplined and later fired for ""attendance issues"" because I was having to go to the bathroom frequently while pregnant (despite having a doctor's note, they still disciplined me). Also, working from home after my child was born caused me to get disciplined because the computer wouldn't log into the VPN on time half the time. Computers would take upwards of 15 minutes to log in but you would be punished for not being on the phone exactly on your start time. Sometimes the computers would take 20 minutes to log in, and you would still get disciplined when it was out of your control. You shouldn't have to arrive 30 minutes early just because your computer is slow. You are only allowed 10 minutes for the bathroom in any given day, and trust me, they watch that time. It doesn't matter if you're sick or not, 10 minutes is all you get. The managers need to know your every word and action and you're not allowed to help the customer in any way outside of predefined solutions. Your hands are tied and every move watched at this company. To top it off, the team leads are often less competent than your coworkers, and they will question your judgement.

People are generally nice. Internal training programs are available for those with time to spare. There are several business resource groups to be involved in as well as Toastmasters which makes the work day/week pleasant.
";"Very work group oriented. Several layoffs so far in 2015 with many more expected. This is a cyclical process that happens every 3 - 5 years. Appears to be done to rid themselves of the aging population as well as under achievers. Cater towards interns and programs involving new hires right out of college offering a robust rotational training in several areas of the business. Unfortunately this is not available to experienced new hires which leaves them to fend for themselves. If you hire in for one function it is difficult to demonstrate other areas of expertise. Internal interviews focus narrowly on achievements at BP and consider related past experience prior to BP useless.

2015-06-26;Cashier;Former Employee;Wonderful town to work in, occasionally frustrating company;"As a cashier at this BP convenience store for nearly 7 years, it was a pleasure to meet so many people in a small town with a very welcoming community. The job was enjoyable and a great way to start my working career in high school. Started at minimum wage and, within 3 years, I reached the hourly rate cap for cashiers. Hours are incredibly flexible and the manager really wants you to be successful, considering this is the first job for some high school students in the area.
";"Although the job isn't physically exhausting, it can be mentally taxing. As with most customer service jobs, some customers can get frustrated easily and may not have patience for a new employee or during a ""rush"" hour. The register technology at this location is almost 20 years old and, admittedly, has been falling apart over the last year. This problem has caused long closures and many headaches for the management and other employees. Hopefully, the company will soon replace the registers with a more up-to-date system.

2015-06-09;Wellwork;Current Employee, more than 10 years;It's surreal;"$$$, pension, matching 401k and yearly bonus... only average though compared to local market. Company is great when it comes to family or medical emergencies. No thanks to management, I think HR probably forces managers to behave like decent human beings on most occasions. Company has clearly done a lot to promote women in the workplace over the last few years. Quite entertaining meetings where you'll see and hear what must be some of the most incompetent, try-hard people on the planet spew a lifetime supply of buzzwords and navigate through the endless wilderness of BP corporate processes and re-organization. Much like living in an episode of 'The Office'.
";"Sickening to see just how much money is wasted. They may as well be lighting piles of money on fire around here. Even with strides made towards promoting women, nepotism and good ol' boy system is alive and well. Hiring and promoting other minorities has clearly fallen short. The only real reason to come to work is the pay. Spineless, boot-lick middle managers report to type-A bullies. Even the simplest decisions get passed up to the second line and VP positions. Pretty sure you need to murder someone before you get fired. Seriously. Incompetent people get passed around group to group (sometimes even promoted) for years. Showing up for work, doing your job and trying to protect the business is often under appreciated. If you really want to go places with this company, be prepared to cultivate personal friendships with managers. Company coddles new engineers, the 'challenge' program is a joke. Process, process, process. BP has a sick obsession with paperwork, checklists, creating do-nothing middle management positions and other non-revenue earning paper pushers. The company is like a wounded animal slowly bleeding out after Macondo. They don't seem to understand there is no reward unless you take risk.

";"Cost-cutting to the point of foolishness.. e.g. getting rid of the ""good"" coffee and leaving the bad.. for a whopping savings of $.25 cents a cup??!! Many layoffs currently (2014 & 2015) in the guise of another ""reorg"" but it's really TONS of offshoring happening to KL, Budapest, BA, Bangalore, etc. Just transferring bad systems & processes to another country.. costs will rise there also and the savings will hence be only short-lived! Not that this matters any to current management.. they will earn their bonus and move on to their next executive role! Reorg's to fix the botched reorg's of the past.. this will continue until the end of time for BP, as management considers that all intelligence lies in the UK so it HEAVILY promotes Brits to Sr. roles (VP's, Directors, etc.). They need to stay busy & build their resume for their next role so every few years it's ""reorg's all-around for everyone at the bar""! If you can tolerate that then the benefits can outweigh the pain.. meanwhile I hope you can find time to do you day job and actually enjoy contributing.. trying to make it a meaningful job/career.. otherwise it's just a paycheck.. good luck!

I like that we are given authority of our unit and I am able to do my duties without constant watch or second guessing. Teamwork is great and so are the people. Great pay and benefits.
";"Management slow to make decisions. BP tends to be reactive instead of proactive. The powers to be make costly and sometimes ill advised decisions in order to appease the safety board. The COW program (control of work) is ineffective, out of control, and should be abolished or simplified. More paper, forms, and meetings do not make you work safer or smarter! Also, BP has too many levels of management and so many made up titles. With this culture, nobody can make a decision without checking with multi parties involved...... Frustrating sometimes!

I worked as in intern within their supply chain department, and they gave me exposure to management at all structures and sought to give me a true view of the company while I was there.
";"They are a bit more old-school. There are definitely some 'gotchas' in their culture indicative that they don't have a full theory of the relationship between employee and employer. There are also rather rigid evaluation and promotion practices that seemed detriment. And there are definitely people there counting down the days until retirement, even people in their 30s.

";"They promote the wrong people. They don't want a true speak-up culture as they might have to look at themselves and realize they don't have a lot of great managers. Talent isn't what gets you promoted. They try to control people by saying ""It's not what you do but how you do it"". That's BS as this is an oil company and ""what we do"" keeps things from blowing up and killing people. They promote for behaviors not how you impact the business or how good your delivery is.

";"The company is risk adverse. After the Texas City and Gulf disasters, there is no appetite to operate assets due to risk exposure. The downstream business is little more than a shell of what it used to be. The company's downsized structure means there really aren't any opportunities to grow.

BP management listened to us Senior staff members and let us do whatever we needed and however we wanted if we could show it would reduce risk and/or lower operational cost. They insisted we maintain a good work life balance so if we had to pull long weekends or evenings as DBAs often do they insisted on giving us comp time on other days. I never once worked more than 80 hours during a 2 week period in my 30 months there. They let us bring on staff in India who could do most work during off hours for us which helped the work life balance even more. Pay was very good.
";"The only real con was suffering from fallout of the Gulf Oil Spill. The reason I'm not there now is budget cuts due to having to pay for that. This was tied as the best place I've ever worked and I'd gladly go back to that team again if the compensation package was similar to last time.

";"Since the Horizon disaster, I have not met anyone who now likes working for BP. Headcount cuts are too deep. Significant brain drain. The happiest employees seem to be the ones getting severance packages. Company continues to bleed cash at unsustainable levels. Drastic headcount, cost, and asset reductions while competitors are growing. Consensus culture inhibits qualified decision-making. Experts not listened to. Tons of processes that are rarely followed, especially HSE and quality. (Most is just market-facing window dressing developed by consultants.) Changing the portfolio strategy to ultra-deep water is a very long term and highly risky decision. It may make the traders happy for a while, but if the ROI is not big or fast enough, it's not a horse to bet on. Job positions are safer in Europe than in North America.

2013-10-07;Team Leader;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Not the company it once was;"BP is a large company, and tries to be one with good values. In the past BP was a company where a strong meritocracy culture prevailed. However, its strength was its weakness, which means a lack of strong business processes allowed for employee room to create as you figured things out. Some would argue this is why we had so many industrial accidents.
";"Following Macondo, it has become more of ""do the right thing for BP"" instead of ""do the right thing"" -- its a subtle but important change. Combine this with weak business processes, and you can imagine the slippery slope when less scrupulous managers acquire power. This is important to understand if you are thinking of entering an employment relationship with BP.

2013-02-06;IT&S Systems Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Approach with caution;"Great health benefits. Westlake campus in Houston has two gyms on-site. A new item from 2012 is the 'wellness' center that you see a doctor for $10 and the pharmacy provides prescriptions at mail order prices without the wait. The campus also has a on-site daycare for dependants.
";"As part of your employment contract you must agree to follow their ""Code of Conduct."" This is a good thing as part of the industry but I have seen good performing employees terminated with the reason, ""Failed to maintain proper records"" even though all employee, training, etc records are maintained and stored 'online'

2013-02-03;Senior Risk Analyst;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Good pay and benefits, no work/life balance in trading;"The pay is really high compared to banks and other companies in energy for risk. Salaries are at the top of the range and bonuses are usually in the 15 - 33% range depending on your grade. Benefits are really good (pension, 401K match, insurance). The people generally are very bright.
";"You probably will be doing the work of people at other companies that get paid a lot more than you. So you'll get high pay, but you'll be doing 2 jobs at least with one of those being little different than the next pay grade higher. That means you can be worked to death at times - not enough time to do both jobs in a day. Feels like an investment bank - everything is the #1 priority, everything is always put on the fast track, seems like you have a million bosses everywhere telling you what to do. Kind of flat organization which can leave you confused as to what you are supposed to be doing.

2013-01-12;Pca;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Challenge development program was not structured properly.;"multi national oil companies expose you to all types of business decisions. Decent training programs and people with deep expertise in their given field.
";"Lack of diversity in management. To many mid level managers with no desire to help advance your career even thought they have deep knowledge that they could transfer to help you and the company succeed. Work life balance is non existent as everyone is trying to protect the space they currently occupy. No real clear career paths once your development program has run its course.

Leaders need to on more accountability.;"Joined after the Deepwater Horizon accident. BP is making great strides to change the way things are done - kudos to all those contributing to the process. A lot of new people being brought in from other energy companies -- lots pof growth opportunities.
";"With growth changes across the company, process improvements are likely to take a few years to see the benefits. Leadership program needs to stress accountabilities at all levels. Talent retention will be challenging.
