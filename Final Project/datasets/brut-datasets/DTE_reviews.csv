2021-08-25;Executive Assistant;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Proud to work for this company;Very customer oriented. ;"antly trying to improve our infrastructure to meet the demands and needs of the customers. Executives are always meeting to discuss customer issues that arise and come up with solutions to address and correct the issues and implement new processes in hopes of preventing them in the future.
Cons
The only downside, if I can even call it that, would be working very long hours during storms to assist in any way I can to provide support to our teams out in the field while they work to restore power to our customers. I don't feel like it is a con, just part of my job and I am willing to help in any way I can.
Advice to Management
Keep up the great work.

";"When storms hit you have four to five hours of forced overtime, they do not care if you have children you should have planned for that.
Very passive aggressive environment, most management seems like somebody who peaked in high school.
Constantly have expectations forced on you that are not realistic for the job being done. Those expectations are set by somebody who does not and has never done the job you do.

- It feels good to work at a company whose purpose is to ""improve lives with our energy.""
- Company is small enough to have a ""family"" vibe but big enough to have a lot of opportunities to learn and grow.
- Strong job security; no layoffs during 2009 Great Recession or 2020 COVID pandemic.
- I'm empowered to set my own work location and hours.
";"- Some groups are bureaucratic.
- Sometimes there are too many priorities.
- No opportunity to work internationally; limited opportunity to work outside of Michigan.

2021-02-07;Individual Contributor;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Career death trap for people of color. No upward mobility here!;"Good benefits, and worklife balance. Cares about employee safety and well being. Company has done an excellent job supporting employees and their families with work from home efforts during the pandemic. The company has really shown itself as a ""Force For Growth in the Community"" as quoted in the company's statement. This is probably the one thing that makes me proud to work here.
";"Company lacks minorities and women in leadership and will go out of their way not to promote minorities from within. I wouldn't recommend anyone who looks like me to come here. While the package to get you in the door may look impressive and promising; your opportunities for advancement are not. On average, a person of color remains in the same job they hired into the company 5 to 10 years later while white counter parts experience 1-2 promotions within that same time span. This company will promote a white person without proper qualifications in a heartbeat, but will pick apart the qualifications of a person of color and find reasons not to promote them. It's truly sad that you can ask any random employee of color (especially black employees) about their career experience and they all have similar stories. In some departments this place is run like a modern day plantation. Dont waste your time complaining about it. The HR, Ethics and Legal departments turn a side eye to everything and you will definitely be retaliated against for speaking up about an issue.
Advice to Management
I'm not sure what to think about the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives the company has now adapted. Right now there is a lot of work going on to promote an inclusive culture. While I am appreciative of these steps- the company has a long way to go. In my opinion the company is still doing a lot of talking the talk but not walking the walk in terms of promotions. The company does a great job hiring minorities but not promoting them. My advice would be to promote minorities from within and stop making them work 10 times harder for opportunities. It's a disgusting practice (rather intentional or unintentional) that really needs to stop.

2021-02-23;Engineer;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Racist Organization;"Not much if your a mininority
";"The culture at DTE is setup so that only white males are allowed to have upward mobility. Minorities (Black, Asian, Hispanic, & Middle-Eastern) should avoid applying here as your career will be held back and your promotional oppurtunties will be limited. 

Your white managers and supervisors will also pick on you just to humiliate you by nit-picking on every little issue and use that as an excuse to pass you up on promotions while the white guys get promoted just for showing up. Its hard to believe that a company based in Detroit will actively discriminate against minorities in such a brutal fashion.

Advice to Management
If possible, provide students with the option to use Windows laptops owned by DTE. Many of us used Macs for schoolwork and may not have the capability to purchase a new laptop/ have access to a Windows laptop, which definitely slows down productivity significantly (speaking as someone who has to use a Mac during the WFH period due to COVID)

CEO is great
";"Nuclear generation is poor performer with respect to industry and not getting significantly better. Night and weekends are typical every week due to some unforeseen equipment or paperwork issue. They say it's getting better but it really isn't. They are burying things that will continue to haunt them for many years to come.

Nuclear senior management is easily the worst I've worked for. Only care about production, NOT people or their work life balance.

HR is silent and letting directors/VP run the place out of control.

401k is pathetic - you have to VEST before you get a dime from the company (greater than 3 years). They either don't make this available to new hires, or it's buried in the fine print.
Advice to Management
You have extremely poor directors, nearly every single one of them. They push all responsibility and accountability to their direct reports and individual contributors and pretend like they are so busy and overworked. 

Your loosing top notch staff because you wanted ""Followers"" vs the leaders you had. 

You had some of the best subject matter experts in the country but didn't set them up for success. They either resigned, left or transferred.

You turn the blinders on and ignore the more important things (that you don't want to hear or deal with) and go after the easy low hanging fruit instead. Wake up!

Advice to Management
Environment needs to be better to employees especially in customer service who are looked down upon. Entry level but a warmer environment is needed for employees to feel valued.

2016-06-30;Staff Engineer;Former Employee;DTE Gas Co.: Great Place To Work, Sad to Leave;"DTE uses ""overpaid consultants"" to figure out what makes a company a good place to work, but they actually listen to the recommendations developed. When I was employed there for two years, we had mandatory meetings to discuss improvements in useful areas of employee engagement (with *actual* support from management). We cared about each-other, and were never afraid to ask questions or sound stupid. As an engineer, that always bothers me, but DTE made me feel comfortable with it.
";"These ""cons"" are very petty, I really can't think of much... My department was old-fashioned, they didn't allow telecommuting at all. They only had one kind of coffee for free. Escalation of actual, legitimate problems took longer than I wanted (but always eventually happened) - it was on the order of months, not days (that's what it's like at a utility company though).
Advice to Management
Keep the current CEO, Jerry Anderson - he's setting the company culture and really cares about doing good work and keeping good company morale. The days can get a little stuffy sometimes (because of the open floor-plan people don't really joke around much, as they're afraid to have others overhear) - So try to set the culture individually yourselves, have fun so your people do too.

2016-01-28;Customer Care Representative;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Customer Care Representative;"Continuous Improvements intentions, Cafeteria, pay on time, good community oriented corporate citizen, nice people work at headquarters, customer service focus.
";"Old fashioned company, the majority of employees have been there for a long time, so they don't know things can be better (benefit package is mediocre), no discount on their services to employees, different departments don't communicate well with each other, low starting pay, my experience left me feeling the company is more interested in their community image and reputation rather than making employees feel valued. I don't feel safe working there. There are many visitors, construction contractors and contracted employees there all the time. I couldn't look at a person and immediately tell they were an employee. Parking isn't very secure. There is a great security presence once inside, but it seemed like I worked in a public place (equivalent to an airport). Too many different unions usually mean problem with management and employee relations. Computer system (CSB) should be retired now!
Advice to Management
Value your employees and your employees will value your customers. Empower frontline employees more. When hiring it would be more beneficial to take advantage of new employee's skills vs. being so rigid with the job description. The opposite occurs when there are unions involved, unfortunately. Considering giving CRs the option of working from home. It would make a better work life balance, especially since there is the use of mandatory overtime. Good luck with the new customer system, because the current one is not very user friendly/efficient. Pay frontline employees appropriately (more), since their job is more important than management's (according to management).
