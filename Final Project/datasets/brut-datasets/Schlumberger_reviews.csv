Business Outlook
Pros
Working on a big code base with a complicated architecture can be very challenging, especially when you need to redesign the code or add system-wide changes. You will also be working on a product with existing customers where your changes will have real-world impact.
";"Everything moves slowly in a big company due to bureaucracy and office politics. The daily schedule will include more meetings and interacting with other employees, so less writing code than in a startup.

2021-10-05;HSE Specialist;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Buy in from management;"If you do your job and don’t slack off they will keep you around.
";"They say they are 100% committed to HSE, but when it comes to stopping the job Operations will more then likely find away around the issue. I never experienced racism, but I witnessed how many of the white field techs would get promoted over Hispanic or African Americans as well as getting more hours. The culture may have changed, but when I was trying to implement the policies that management should have been implementing there was always push back from management and employees. They hire a lot of family members or friends of friends which also gives others an unfair advantage when it comes to promotions and disciplinary actions. Management definitely has their favorite employees and it shows. Schlumberger forces employees to do 52 stop cards annually which makes the stop cards (RIR) ineffective. I’d rather have quality reports than quantity. Oh and the bonuses are a joke unless you are upper management. It’s like working for a sinking ship when oil prices are down. It truly was unpleasant when you never know which day can be your last. If it’s not the “it’s Schlumberger making us do it” excuse it’s the “well we have to keep you at 40 hours to save jobs.” or “we don’t have money to fix this issue.”

";"Very disconnected from HR. Not easy to navigate through the company due to its size and minimal IT and disconnected HR. Play the game right and you can advance without accomplishing much of anything. Get too good at your job and you might get stuck without any ability to advance.

So the fear of being released is constant - Once you surpass the B6 grade you become a target to be released, regardless of performance - Downturn has been used as the excuse to reduce the population so drastically, but it rather is the transformation program that the are executing rather than real business outlook. - Downturn and ""multiskilling"" are the reasons to make people wear three hats.

";"The industry as a whole is in trouble long-term, SLB is trying to be progressive but at the end of the day it is an O&G company. Being a part of a service company in a struggling industry is tough, cuts are usually harsh and deep, but it is something you have to accept. As for the company itself, biggest con is the same with most large companies. The corporate mentality/approach to everything can be taxing, but again, you have to accept it with any large employer.

";"-They pay as salary starting out so the pay (low per hour worked) and hours (13hr days weeks non-stop) are terrible, you would make more per hour working at Walmart, McDonald's etc. -Online training is extensive but often not job-relevant and you have to complete it on your personal time with no financial compensation. -Most job skills and training is D&M specific to running only SLB tools and has little to no outside engineering application other than other D&M jobs

Diversity of roles and learning opportunities are just as apparent as the diversity of SLB's workforce. It's hard to imagine the breadth of friendships I've made at SLB existing in other places.
";"Sometimes the change is constant and unstopping and it seems that SLB is changing for change's sake. Because there is a lot of inward movement and mobility within SLB, you get different managers and different teams to work with and so you must remain flexible as different managers bring different personalities and styles and focus.

This leads to a lot of people placed in open positions that they do not want but accept it because they feel they are given no other option to move forward, and people that have skill sets beyond their current role have no opportunity to present themselves and interview for something they would prefer or be better suited for as often times direct management has no knowledge or interest in understanding their subordinates motivations or talents and do not have contacts outside of their departments.

I think that those who you work with make or break the job, and while I enjoyed working with my manager and coworkers, I know of others who went through hell. If you are a woman then you should prepare yourself for sexual harassment. I know of a few women who not only faced uncomfortable situations on the rig (which sadly should be expected if you ever work in the field) but also during schlumberger training from both their peers and instructors. My manager was a woman, so I don't believe that there is anything holding back women from being successful just be prepared for a possible uncomfortable environment.

Aug 8, 2020 - Mechanical Engineer in Sugar Land, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
- Dynamic work environment - Dedicated, hardworking coworkers - Lots of training, friendly environment, they want you to learn and be safe above all else - Salary was very good, higher Bottom line: I loved my coworkers and loved the work I did, and that, to me, exceeded the cons of redundant paperwork and excessive meetings. Due to the ease of layoffs, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this job unless you are young and wouldn't be severely impeded by a layoff (as opposed to a parent, or someone looking for more stability, someone mid-career, etc).
Cons
- Too many meetings could have been emails - A lot of redundancy in internal paperwork - Depending on your position and seniority, a lot of people take their work home with them (answering emails off hours, etc). It's not necessary to do so, but many people do. This is more true for manufacturing engineers. - Very quick to lay off BUT they do provide a severance package I would describe as fair to good.

There is a huge library of knowledge for you to learn while working. The dynamic environment under high volume and tight deadlines increases your adaptability skills set as well as time management and presentation skills. Be mindful that this will change depending on the location, department and team you work on.
";"The constant and multiple changes to be implemented at the same time give a sense of unpreparedness / unpremeditated / improvisation, specially when no proper training is provided or when after several working hours of implementation the project is left aside to work on another one. High employee rotation. The lack of a meaningful Performance Management Evaluation considered by HR as well makes Networking KEY. Minimal HR impact. Since the Co is Engineering based and focused, finance has been minimized to an internal ""outsourcing formatting"" structure.
