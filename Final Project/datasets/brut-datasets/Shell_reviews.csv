Advice to Management
Don't buy into the corporate values mumbo jumbo, managers don't lead by example. If you face harassment, don't bother to complain to HR, because HR will only protect the managers, not you. Complaining will only lead to retaliation, even though HR tells you it is not allowed, don't believe it. Essentially, your career will be gone. Best is to move to another company, and don't wait too long like me.

2021-08-20;Project Engineer;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Mixed Review - Experience will vary;"Very high pay compared to other engineering jobs. Starting salary was 50% higher out of college than average starting salary for someone with an engineering degree. Bonus is good (when we get one). Great relocation benefits when the company asks you to move. Work-life balance can be good depending on your role.
";"Strange company culture. The company expects employees to work for them forever. Company expects 100% loyalty, but doesn't offer it in return. Talking about anything outside the company is taboo, whether it is an idea that originated from outside the company, part-time continuing education at a university, or future career plans. Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take. Company moved IT and HR to an offshore call center. Anytime you need to talk to someone from HR or IT you need to call a 1800 number and get put on hold for hours and then receive poor customer service. The company's back office financial department is a mess. Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another. Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know. Company expects you to relocate with your family every few years. I've seen this destroy families. Very burocratic company, everything is driven by process, but it seems like nobody knows the process, and it seems like there are multiple processes for the same thing.
Advice to Management
None, I think the company is so big that things are not able to be changed.

2021-08-17;Material Planner;Former Employee, more than 1 year;WARNING....Worst Work/life balance;"Worked at Shell in Woodcreek in Houston, TX. The only thing that was worth about working for Shell oil sector was the pay. Eventhough I never received a bonus.
";"No bonus because they are subjective based on how the company performs. 

The worst work/life balance I had ever experience. They ""give"" you every other Friday off, however, you better be online working or else you will fall behind. I would find myself working sometimes until midnight during the week to keep up with work. At times, I would work on the weekends to stay up to date and would notice my coworkers and cross-functional teams would be doing the same as they would be ""online"" via skype. Shell used skype (like many use Zoom) for you to show your online status (offline, away, in a meeting, etc.). Managers would use your online status to gauge how ""good"" of an employee you were. I was warned/counseled by my upper management because they noticed my online status had been ""away"" 3 times in a day for 20 mins each time and to them that was unacceptable. Diversity and Inclusion is not a top priority. If your last name did not start with ""Van something"" or you are not Dutch, forget about climbing the corporate ladder there. Dealt with 5 reorganizations in two years, which means it is very unstable and many people kept getting laid off.
Advice to Management
Stop walking around the floors like you are some big shot and humble yourselves.

";"Downstream is worse than upstream. These comments are related to downstream at Shell. Sr leaders do no stay in their roles long enough. Result….they don’t know what they are doing. They only manage for the qtr, week, day…not for long term profitability or viability. Everyone there is just looking to keep their head down so they don’t fired. They say you are free to speak your mind….you are not. You can say only what they want to hear…but really challenge and you will be gone at the next re-0rg. They Re-org about every 2-3 years. Not a great place to work.
Advice to Management
Keep Sr leaders in their role for 6+ year at a min. 
Set up businesses so 2-3 level of management can run their whole show without a ton of other approvals needed….and hold them accountable for results.
Fire all the Sr leaders of today….they are worthless.

2021-05-31;Senior IT Manager;Former Employee, more than 10 years;IT Innovation at Retaliation;"Company was extremely committed to ethics, the environment, innovation and betterment of it's people and community most of the time I worked there. Something has changed.
";"I was informed, during a two year extreme harassment and ""online shame"" campaign, formal retaliation has been taking place by the IT department through vendors and strategic recruiters/IT contingent workforce suppliers. The attackers claimed I had reported a boss for ""harassment"" (implying sexual harassment). I had made a report about a boss changing names on important documents. It handled well by the company at the time.

 I wound up leaving the company a year later, definitely NOT because I was pushed out, but because it was time to stretch after 15 years. What I found out really happened was systematic blacklisting at new jobs by IT leaders on a reactive and false premise that I had made a harassment claim to the company. I recall the benevolent warning from a contractor (military background) working with security risk teams about Shell using the vendors and third party partners to do the blacklisting. This ultimately became true, yet it also indicates the IT security and risk organizations are well aware of what they are doing by using category /suppliers this way.

One recruiter tried to negotiate my salary down WELL below market value, while two organizations were just odd I had worked with and I wondered why the tone had changed suddenly to very hostile.
Advice to Management
Consider the chilling effect of retaliation which can result in individuals not making the right reports about ethics and safety issues. Further training for IT management on anti-retaliation policy. In depth review of the practices of the IT strategic recruiters, information security information sharing consortiums, and suppliers /consulting firms regarding both their privacy (I was digitally stalked) and anti-retaliation practices. Ratings were five star, yet now I have learned a lot after a severe incident and deliberately (possibly funded) harassment campaign.

* Possibility of pension

* Some people your work with

*Supports diversity

*Preaches safety

Only recommend this place if your looking for a higher salary (overall benefits actually suck)
";"Something along the lines of 'Nimble as a mid-major, capable as a Super Major'.... was a slogan that was paraded around the office, this couldn't be further from truth. I laughed every time I heard it or saw it written down.

* Your constantly working in fear b/c of reorganizations/layoffs. I was with Shell for two years and survived three reorganizations... let that sink in, three reorganizations within two years... 

* US leadership is inept; Shell is EXTREMELY top heavy and they don't care about the individual contributor. To survive and move up in the organization its all about politics. New roles are created for leadership when their position is eliminated/reorg'ed.

* Little to no diversity in leadership

* Terrible work-life balance, working through lunch and after hours was a norm, very lean teams

* Shell does a poor job leveraging technology and relies heavily on its people, burn out was constant; spreadsheets without analytics or dashboards. Things could easily be automated but leadership has no interest in it b/c of the work/testing/downtime involved, business as usual attitude. 

* Majority of IT is outsourced to consultants in India where turnover is rampant... Good luck getting an IT project/initiative off the ground without delays or having something somewhere else break.

* New initiatives are constantly being rolled out only to be ignored or replaced a few months later.

* They are slowly ""migrating""/outsourcing jobs out of the US. Majority of IT and Accounting is already outsourced to Asia. Rumors were HR is on the chopping block next

* Extremely inefficient process flows, leadership has little to no interest in addressing it

* Benefits are actually lousy: 3% 401k match; a windowed RDS share purchase plan; hardly any local, regional, or national offers; health insurance is EXPENSIVE; etc.

* Its great that you preach safety, but your record speaks otherwise

2021-03-15;IT Advisor;Current Employee, more than 5 years;Decent place to work;"Shell has a solid benefits package and pays well for the region I'm in. Working as an IT advisor in the manufacturing space provides lots of exposure to IT and business processes which has served as an excellent learning opportunity. Hours are usually stable with some extra work expected around major maintenance events and during large projects.
";"Collaboration with overseas colleagues can be challenging especially with so many support roles outsourced to India. 5AM is their evening so finding overlapping working hours is nearly impossible.
Bonuses are tied to the oil price and profitability of the company. While I understand that, some of my highest performing years have been years when bonuses have been cut to 0%.
While technical knowledge is valued, my role as an advisor doesn't allow me to focus much on individual technologies. I feel a mile wide and an inch deep on many technical topics because of this.
Shell constantly talks about upskilling and spending work time on training. However I have found that they rarely actually make time for anything but basic training.

Advice to Management
Strive to change from a company that thinks it knows it all... to one that tries to continually learn and grow and adapt. The arrogance of the former is stifling and unattractive culturally, to gen-ex's, millennials and younger generation employees. Also, walk the talk in upper management when it comes to diversity. A leadership board full of white boomer males sends the wrong message.

I lovingly referred to it as my glass ceiling. There are periods when they hire management from other companies, which disincentivized people in management to stay. (Look at the bios of top management in the US to see if they left Shell and came back.) Maybe this has changed since I have left, but it’s something to keep in mind for career planning.

Wonderful pay and benefits; they are targeted at the 75th percentile. The company is extremely concerned about your health & safety and work-life balance. The full package here is practically unbeatable.
";"Most of the IT staff is in India. If you're in the US, 5:00 and 6:00 AM meetings are not unusual (but not really common). If you're in India, expect to be on calls after 7 with US staff. You may not be on the same continent with the rest of your team or your lead or your manager.

It's still a consensus-based culture, and I'd like to see more managers able to make the tough decision and move forward, even if not everyone agrees. It still feels like it takes too long for anything to happen.

Weekly 1-on-1s with your supervisor are not part of the culture.
Advice to Management
Require everyone's annual performance goals to be measurable and have a time component. All of the GPAs I saw (in IT) up the line had at least a couple vaguely defined goals that were written so that there was no way to be accountable for not achieving the goal.

Jan 23, 2021 - Senior Mechanical Engineer in Houston, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
Very good health insurance, 401k, pension, bonus (performance bonus and turnaround bonus).
Cons
Work life balance is non existent at a refinery/chemical plant.
Been with Shell for 7 years and went thru 3 reorg/layoffs already. Seems like the industry growth isn’t just slowing, it’s contracting.
Management decision is very slow. They seem to have lofty goals but doesn’t really accomplish them. More and more I feel like management is trying to push more and more site wide initiatives onto individual contributors which is frustrating because individual contributors don’t have the same pull as a manager or senior manager.
Constantly in meetings that feel like nothing is accomplished and no value is added.
Advice to Management
Keep large initiatives at management level. Have more vision than just cost cutting and “becoming more lean” because it clearly isn’t making the impact that it should. Try looking at more options to make more money rather than putting all of your focus on spending less.

Great people, work is interesting and challenging, good pay and benefits.
Cons
Processes are constantly changing, reorgs occur often, managers change over frequently. When oil prices are good, things are great in refining, but when oil prices are low, it becomes cost cutting and fire sales everywhere.
