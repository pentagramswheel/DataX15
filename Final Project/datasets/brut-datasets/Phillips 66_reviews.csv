2021-08-20;Scheduler;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Steady decline;"Nice facility. Reasonable benefits and pay
";"Benefits, culture, and effective pay (for most employees) has steadily declined. Minimal pay increases are offset, sometimes totally, by backdoor benefits cost increases. Benefits definitely slanted toward upper management. Newer employees (less than 7 years) don’t realize what has been lost. And most of them don’t look at benefits cost affect to be aware of what happened.
Advice to Management
Really value employees instead of just talking it. Bonus opportunities taken away for all except for select few. At one point all employees got stock options. Now only upper management. Fix employee rating that is slanted to favorites. Give lower level employees some incentives. Now wherever you start is probably where you will stay

";"Bartlesville quality of life. Supervisors and managers spend most of their time in meetings. The annual performance rating system ""calibration"" process boils down to favoritism and your supervisor's ability to advocate for you, rather than your actual contributions. Excessive random drug testing program that is skewed toward younger employees rather than the entire population. The company's safety fetish results in corporate employees being treated like children, where employees can tattle on other employees for not using handrails or crosswalks. The Bartlesville employee parking lot has a flashing speed limit sign/radar that captures your speed as you enter the parking lot and security guards regularly park in the lot in the mornings to watch for ""speeding"" employees.

2021-05-11;Mechanical Engineer;Current Employee, less than 1 year;Decent benefits and decent work life balance;"-Competitive salary to other oil companies. Lower salary than Exxon, but the yearly bonus makes up for it and I've heard the salary raises are less frequent at Exxon.
- 19/30 schedule is nice to have
- Respectful of when you want to take vacation.
- Co workers are easy to get along with.
- Lots of room to grow and be promoted if you put the time in.
";"- Work life balance goes away during turnaround seasons.
- Little communication from upper management about decisions and their reasons.
- 19/30s not as nice as 9/80s.
Advice to Management
Try to include employees in the decision making process. There are many times when turnaround schedules get moved or maintenance priorities shift and most people don't understand why.

";"My line of work is an important part of our company strategy, yet it is glaringly obvious management does not appreciate or understand it. Limited opportunities for growth. Handling of employees/in-office return in May 2020 (during pandemic) was disturbing. Workplace flexibility is non-existent; ""we are a work from work culture"", management is constantly shifted around and never become specialists, in my experience.
Advice to Management
Be open to new ideas instead of doing things the way they have always been done. Offer some sort of flexibility or work from home option, even as little as 1-2 days per month. Be transparent with decisions that involve employee health, ie: dismal handling of pandemic & return to office protocol.

Business Outlook
Pros
Great compensation and benefits
Interesting work opportunities. Wide variety of experiences. 
Continuous training available. 
Some parts of the company still honor the companies strong core values.
Cons
Cultural shift underway. 

Moving to more outsourcing and management of contracts and less emphasis on people and career development. 

Current upper management has turned a blind eye towards several ethical violations and increasing attrition (including many key resources) is seen as collateral damage. 

Business strategy transformation is happening but nothing groundbreaking. AE66 has a great marketing campaign but real results are questionable.

Overall the company has both a strong business and people strategy, but leaders are not being held accountable to walk the talk.
Advice to Management
Need to think about how the nature of work is transforming and adapt accordingly. Asking employees to adapt to rapid change but not offering the same in return.

Company is self-insured thru BCBS, Aetna, or another provider depending on the location you're in. Great HSA or FSA health plan options. Excellent life insurance, long & short-term disability. Vacation days contingent on experience (10/yr if you're fresh out of college, add 5 days for every 5 years of experience). Add in a floating holiday and monthly ""19/30"" days that have to be used within the month. Some teams are excellent and it's entirely possible to have a wonderful set of immediate colleagues & supervisor.
";"IT leadership in shambles. CIO resigned, possibly because he was effectively made into a co-CIO with 5 or 6 other senior IT folks. Poor coordination, too many cooks in the kitchen. Lots of other senior or longstanding middle IT managers leaving the company, taking valuable historical knowledge with them. Lack of leadership makes it very difficult to get the ""easy wins"" done, like deploying out-of-the-box updates for standard applications. Stuff that should take 20 min can take 6 months, under the right mix of bad circumstances. 

2021 merit increases have been ""deferred"" indefinitely. Not a shocker considering the state of the industry. Haven't had layoffs to the extent of Exxon, BP, etc., but a few dozen people were let go in late 2020. Most teams in IT are already skeleton crews. Bonuses are expected to be drastically reduced this year, or eliminated entirely; normally they are 10% or more of salary.

Culture very oriented towards physical safety when I joined. That all went out the window when everyone was forced back to the office in May/June 2020. Hard to take the ""Hold the handrail"" rules seriously when mask-wearing is not enforced stringently. Working remotely is not an option for most corporate HQ staffs, even though many can and did work remotely with great success from March-May 2020. Understandably the situation is different at refineries, but those teams are also spread out over larger sites, which can make social distancing easier.

Appoint a CIO. Let that person have true authority and autonomy to orchestrate changes.

";"Not as efficient with time/company costs as I had initially assumed. Meets and company update events seem to be somewhat in excess. This pulls away from staffed areas creating more strain on departments, etc. Also, if contracted, you may be competing for one employee position(benefits, advancement,etc) among 5 contractors. Expect to be a Contractor for quite some time.
Advice to Management
I think management is relaxed, which is nice. However, the more subtle issues like employee/contractor accountability is something needing addressed higher in the chain of things. Also being able to accurately note individual efforts and successes would greatly drive competitiveness among employees/contractors and justify moral. I feel if the little things were addressed and tightened, the company as a whole would/could be even greater!

2020-08-14;Operator/Technician;Former Employee, more than 3 years;Some great people but the company/job is not for everyone;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.


-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)

-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.


-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn

-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.

-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.
";"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. 

-The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). 


-Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?


-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...

-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". 

-There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.


-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. 


-The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""


-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.


-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".
Advice to Management
Stop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.

2020-07-10;Corporate Engineering Advisor;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Very Old School, Siloed, and Dysfunctional;"Benefits are good and above average. Good office building.
";"As an experienced hire, new views were not welcomed. The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.
Advice to Management
Be open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff. They might find out what is working and not working more.

2020-07-21;Business Analyst;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Don't work here unless you want to put yourself at risk for Covid-19;"Work life balance and somewhat job security
";"This company is stuck in the 1960s and refuses to adapt to the times for some reason. With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.

There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.
Advice to Management
Your refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.

";"Most managers don't have working spouses so company is not very family friendly. If your kid is sick you take a vacation day. Yet, salaried people are required to respond to emergencies 24/7 without pay as well as being on call for work support 24/7. You may support an incident in the middle of the night or weekend with a 8-12 hour window without compensation. There's a few jobs that senior employees can do outside of Corp HQ but those opportunities are only provided a few select key males. Males seem to be promoted more readily than females with similar skill sets. Also, although there are more and more female employees in technical roles I won't share my job title or location. I can easily figure out who posted review for other locations since there aren't that many females in Tech roles.
Advice to Management
Try to be competitive with not only O&G industry but other industries. Money is made in the facilities, not Corp office. Give more support to sites where the work is actually happening. The money spent for the waterfall in the Corp HQ office could have gone to better use in the field.

2019-10-27;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Good start;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). 

Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. 

Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.
";"Limited vacation time (usually 10 days), but the company does have 10 dedicated holidays (Christmas, etc). Also, some jobs are eligible for the ""19/30"" program, which gives you an extra day off each moth so long as you work 8.5 hours per day (instead of 8 - up to you if you'd want to do that in any given month).
Advice to Management
Don't do away with the long-term benefits like the pension system; it's what brings good people in and keeps them around.

They share anything they can to help you learn and be successful. They treat you as if you’re a full time employee and a part of their team. They invest in you and your learning and growth.
