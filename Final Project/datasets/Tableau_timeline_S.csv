Chevron;17/07/2019;99.81190585125313;I recommend this job to anyone. If anyone is thinking of applying to this job go for it but make sure it's for a corporate station. I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back);Insurance

The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm.

There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously.

Phillips66;14/08/2020;99.57297544608817;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.";Ageism
Phillips66;16/06/2020;98.20039652280008;The benefits are great. Lots of opportunities to get into different fields in the company. Phillips 66 will pay for your CPA study materials and reimburse you for all 4 parts of your CPA exam! The best part is you don’t have to have a CPA to be an accountant with this company. Wonderful team atmosphere with management that supports your goals.;Ageism
Phillips66;27/10/2019;100.0;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.";Ageism

I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency.

I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing.

They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously.

Phillips66;14/08/2020;99.57297544608817;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.";Benefits

Phillips66;27/10/2019;100.0;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.";Benefits

I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff. Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees.

Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron.

I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing.

Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey. In a sense, you may look back every now and then and say; “You don’t know what want till it’s gone”.

Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing.

It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously.

They also take care of the tuition and they provide book allowance each semester that is $ 1000. The pay a close attention to their student with a visit each semester and a private meeting with each student to check up on them. They give also rewards each semester for those who perform well that ranges from ( 500$ to 1000$) depending on their GPA.

Chevron;17/07/2019;99.81190585125313;I recommend this job to anyone. If anyone is thinking of applying to this job go for it but make sure it's for a corporate station. I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back);Privacy

Chevron;22/03/2019;94.57577144019116;The benefits package at Chevron is literally unmatched in any other company or industry that I have seen. I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance.;Privacy

Phillips66;14/08/2020;99.57297544608817;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.";Resources

Phillips66;27/10/2019;100.0;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.";Resources

Duke;01/10/2020;99.54247369223732;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.";Resources

You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb.

Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.;Resources

I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back);Resources

BP;25/02/2009;99.9339128666565;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks. I appreciate the fact that even if they are truly at heart an oil company, they are taking steps to create a greener company. Overall, I am pretty happy with the company, for what it is and what industry it is in.";Resources

Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey.

Phillips66;21/07/2020;-6.730286288297336;"This company is stuck in the 1960s and refuses to adapt to the times for some reason. With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.Advice to ManagementYour refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.11 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Insurance

Expectations for themselves is lower than what they expect of individual workers. Duke expects you to wear a beeper 24/7 and be available for call out and come to work within 75 minutes but there is no compensation for this. They do not respect work/life balance. More and more they expect doing more work with fewer people. They expect workers to just absorb work when people leave.;Insurance

Inside of one month many changes were made and are ongoing. Less than six months after I exposed the poor safety culture, the West Storage facility blew up. I wish I had acted sooner. After that I began to feel much pressure and less cooperation and help from the safety department. It was obvious I was on my way out. That pressure along with them putting me in unsafe situations broke my health and they would not find work for me and I was 'eased out' on LTD.

There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit.

They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs.

It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling.

The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork.

Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours. Facilities outside of San Francisco are often very basic or even shoddy. If considering a position outside of SF, make sure to tour the work site.

When hiring it would be more beneficial to take advantage of new employee's skills vs. being so rigid with the job description. The opposite occurs when there are unions involved, unfortunately. Considering giving CRs the option of working from home. It would make a better work life balance, especially since there is the use of mandatory overtime.

Most of the people are great to work with but supervisors are mostly micromanagers, diversity is not their strongest suit. Lots of white males in upper management. Too much discrimination at the workplace, sutle but it's there. Some of the operators won't like you because you're a young engineer coming in to tell them how to do their job, it takes time and patience to build a connection with them but overall great people to work with. Lots of fake people go behind your back to talk bad about you. Work hours can be crazy, it's part of the job description that you have your work phone with you 24/7. Anyone at the plant can contact you so say bye to Work-Life balance. If you do have a doctor's appt. or so you can get time off or be allowed to come to work late, supervisors do differ. Work hours can be long, when you're new it's expected you're at the plant later than everyone getting to know your unit and operators. ExxonMobil has a ranking system every year to discuss your performance but if your supervisor doesn't like you, you won't have someone to defend your work and speak for you. They do allow you to have Knowledgable Others that can speak on your character and work ethics but your peers are competing with you so not a lot of people you can trust to speak highly of you. Advice: go to work do your job and work hard if you're a POC waiting for recognition don't count on it, your counterparts would get recognized before you. The supervisors secretly will give you more than you can do so you don't look good to management.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Balance

Underachievers are routinely promoted and picked to manage teams, with distraous results to employee performance and team morale. Management pulls on high performing employees to carry the weight with little recognition. Work/life balance is laughable, especially during severe weather. Your life is driven by daily weather forecasts. Diversity and inclusion is all talk, with no follow through. There are few leadership opportunities for people of color and no diversity training for managers. There is open racism with no repercussions. The company is routinely awarded for its diversity practices, which is puzzling given the realities. HR is ill equipped to lead a 21st century workplace.;Balance

Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.Advice to ManagementMove the HQ out of Findlay and step into the 21st century with regards to work practices and work/life balance.

If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them.

Yes you had to deal with a ranking system that destroyed any attempt of having a collaborative environment, and culture was focused on following procedures and working for complying with internal audits instead of fostering new ideas and teamwork, but working hard was typically rewarded and you could count on a long term career… Everything dramatically changed the last couple of years, ranking system was redesigned to make it easier to place employees at the bottom, you could be a sustained good performer for 5+ years and suddenly end up being offered a 3 lay off package for having had a “bad year”. There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit. This has been a fundamental shift away from what used to be company core values, and a real shame. Unless this is your only option, I would discourage anyone to join EM at the moment.18 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Retirement
ExxonMobil;06/06/2021;-83.56102461074838;Jobs are being cut all over Europe, Canada, Singapore and the USA to move jobs to locations where costs are cheaper. People being hired in many of these locations do not have the same dedication to the company and realize that they make less so when you get a supervisor or manager from one of these countries when you work in the USA expect resentment. The management in the USA talked for years that people were hired for a career from college to retirement but they have pushed people out by increasing poor performers to as high as 10% in some years to avoid paying layoff packages. The company forced many people to retire. The company cares about employees only if they are cheap to pay. Early in a person's career they are identified to be a top performer and after that time you can fall from being a top performer but it is almost impossible to get into the top rankings each year once the company has decided your career level in your first few years at the company.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Retirement

ExxonMobil;20/02/2021;-96.1175288799598;"Upper management is detached, reactive, and apparently incompetent. The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy. Finally, the brand is toxic and the company knows it.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Retirement

Phillips66;14/08/2020;-98.00602712204922;"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. -The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). -Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". -There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. -The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".Advice to ManagementStop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.6 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Retirement

The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff.

With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office.

You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Retirement

There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit.

The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader.

Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company.

These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs.

If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.

They have close to zero idea on how to grow the company (“Business Development”) and assume an operations mindset is transferable to BD. In the past 2-years, near- Constant reorganization has gutted BD; about 20-mid-to-senior BD executives (especially in the M&C group) have been summarily fired or just quit. People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management. The annual strategy meetings are an example of kiss-up, kick down. Net-net, the company is losing contracts to its competitors. Again, VNA is an OK place if you want an operations focused career. But stay away if you want to do Business Development.6 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Culture
Veolia;30/07/2019;-91.90356604721242;Laboratory management loves to micromanage employees. Expect to be criticized if you do things your way. Theres a lot of gossip going around with the senior staff who bad mouth other employees. Very little to no team player effort by senior staff. They will belittle you, and information does not spread evenly through staff. You will hear differences in information within the department. The laboratory needs to work on their Environmental, Health, and Safety culture as well. Some fume hoods did not work, which leads to higher exposure of hazardous chemicals. There is favoritism as well. Little to no upward mobility within the laboratory even after I assumed more responsibility after another employee left. They will overwork you, and still won't offer you more pay. Overall, I would say the lab has a very unprofessional atmosphere and toxic work culture.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Culture

On average, a person of color remains in the same job they hired into the company 5 to 10 years later while white counter parts experience 1-2 promotions within that same time span. This company will promote a white person without proper qualifications in a heartbeat, but will pick apart the qualifications of a person of color and find reasons not to promote them. It's truly sad that you can ask any random employee of color (especially black employees) about their career experience and they all have similar stories. In some departments this place is run like a modern day plantation. Dont waste your time complaining about it. The HR, Ethics and Legal departments turn a side eye to everything and you will definitely be retaliated against for speaking up about an issue.Advice to ManagementI'm not sure what to think about the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives the company has now adapted. Right now there is a lot of work going on to promote an inclusive culture. While I am appreciative of these steps- the company has a long way to go. In my opinion the company is still doing a lot of talking the talk but not walking the walk in terms of promotions. The company does a great job hiring minorities but not promoting them.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be.

Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Racism

Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take.

The company's back office financial department is a mess. Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another. Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know.

Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is.

You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Sexism

If you face harassment, don't bother to complain to HR, because HR will only protect the managers, not you.

Chevron;16/11/2018;-99.58814665996985;- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;Sexism

If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no.

Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same.

People being hired in many of these locations do not have the same dedication to the company and realize that they make less so when you get a supervisor or manager from one of these countries when you work in the USA expect resentment. The management in the USA talked for years that people were hired for a career from college to retirement but they have pushed people out by increasing poor performers to as high as 10% in some years to avoid paying layoff packages. The company forced many people to retire. The company cares about employees only if they are cheap to pay. Early in a person's career they are identified to be a top performer and after that time you can fall from being a top performer but it is almost impossible to get into the top rankings each year once the company has decided your career level in your first few years at the company.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Ageism

Almost all benefits were cut last year while the company shareholder dividend was maintained, and no raises were given out. There is extremely low morale, but with current leadership, it is being ignored rather than addressed. Claims of the utmost focus on quality go out the window when production metrics are threatened.

The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy.

ExxonMobil;28/01/2021;-94.70617780010043;As a Person of Color, my time with ExxonMobil was quite stressful. Most of the people are great to work with but supervisors are mostly micromanagers, diversity is not their strongest suit. Lots of white males in upper management. Too much discrimination at the workplace, sutle but it's there. Some of the operators won't like you because you're a young engineer coming in to tell them how to do their job, it takes time and patience to build a connection with them but overall great people to work with. Lots of fake people go behind your back to talk bad about you. Work hours can be crazy, it's part of the job description that you have your work phone with you 24/7. Anyone at the plant can contact you so say bye to Work-Life balance. If you do have a doctor's appt. or so you can get time off or be allowed to come to work late, supervisors do differ. Work hours can be long, when you're new it's expected you're at the plant later than everyone getting to know your unit and operators. ExxonMobil has a ranking system every year to discuss your performance but if your supervisor doesn't like you, you won't have someone to defend your work and speak for you. They do allow you to have Knowledgable Others that can speak on your character and work ethics but your peers are competing with you so not a lot of people you can trust to speak highly of you. Advice: go to work do your job and work hard if you're a POC waiting for recognition don't count on it, your counterparts would get recognized before you.

Lack of leadership makes it very difficult to get the ""easy wins"" done, like deploying out-of-the-box updates for standard applications.

Phillips66;14/08/2020;-98.00602712204922;"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. -The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). -Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". -There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. -The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".Advice to ManagementStop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.6 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Ageism

The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff. They might find out what is working and not working more.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Ageism

With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.Advice to ManagementYour refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.11 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Ageism

These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game. Reason is, these people are still employed and will be the next set of managers in the next 5 years... the cycle continues.";Ageism

While it is possible to get a new role and develop professionally at ConocoPhillips, there are a lot of politics at play and there are Talent Management Teams (TMT's) that play a huge role in placing employees in new roles that are not always in the employees best interest and development, it's usually for the benefit of the company. Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees.

The computer systems line employees interface with are 10-20 years out of date. The staffing model, driven by seniority and cronyism, promotes uneducated legacy employees beyond their level of competence. The Tone at the Top, both in corporate management and business unit management, is focused on control, constricting employee autonomy and stifling innovation. Decision making is paralyzed by fear of risk. While the pay is above market, the opportunities are decidedly limited. Any college finance course will teach you that an option is worth money.

Duke;01/10/2020;7.105427357601002e-15;"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Ageism

Talking about anything outside the company is taboo, whether it is an idea that originated from outside the company, part-time continuing education at a university, or future career plans. Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take. Company moved IT and HR to an offshore call center. Anytime you need to talk to someone from HR or IT you need to call a 1800 number and get put on hold for hours and then receive poor customer service. The company's back office financial department is a mess. Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another. Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know.

The attackers claimed I had reported a boss for ""harassment"" (implying sexual harassment). I had made a report about a boss changing names on important documents. It handled well by the company at the time. I wound up leaving the company a year later, definitely NOT because I was pushed out, but because it was time to stretch after 15 years. What I found out really happened was systematic blacklisting at new jobs by IT leaders on a reactive and false premise that I had made a harassment claim to the company. I recall the benevolent warning from a contractor (military background) working with security risk teams about Shell using the vendors and third party partners to do the blacklisting. This ultimately became true, yet it also indicates the IT security and risk organizations are well aware of what they are doing by using category /suppliers this way.One recruiter tried to negotiate my salary down WELL below market value, while two organizations were just odd I had worked with and I wondered why the tone had changed suddenly to very hostile.Advice to ManagementConsider the chilling effect of retaliation which can result in individuals not making the right reports about ethics and safety issues.

GeneralElectric;26/02/2020;-1.3410346559517805;1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareReportGE ResponseSocial Media ConsultantThank you for sharing.

Aramco;12/09/2021;-3.7820190858864886;1. Locals will be privileged. Expats will go nowhere from their hired positions. 2. Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is. More landmines to get dinged by whenever the umpteenth priority 1 item simply can’t be dealt with in the expected manner - time and qualitatively comprehensively. The priority changes on a daily basis at any given hour sometimes even 2-3 times a day.;Ageism

Managers often can't make decisions and don't read for more than 30 seconds - which may mean a shift in your expectations - or you can just allow it to irritate you; or you can just carry on and smile. The camp families tend to be a bit cliquey, so if you don't fit their social circle you could be politely avoided. Specific religious beliefs, married or single, that kind of clique.

Many supervisors have a control issue. If you say one thing, they will make you do the opposite just so they can be right. I have heard from peers that the HR hotline number is useless, only creates more trouble and should never be used even though the company promotes the hotline. Inflexible work schedule.

Chevron;03/03/2019;-37.76494224008036;- Out-dated talent management practices. They still use personnel development committees to pay and rank people, which can lead to great inefficiencies (days upon days spent going over ratings and it leads to a highly political environment while also making employees feel undervalued). It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling. There are committees for literally everything that circle around with little impact and many people on these committees feel they need to critique things for the sake of saying they made a contribution to the committee.;Ageism

Chevron;16/11/2018;-99.58814665996985;- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;Ageism
Chevron;24/09/2018;-91.6373681567052;Refinery Experience: The company has the worst business models I’ve come across. Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels.

The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years.

They have close to zero idea on how to grow the company (“Business Development”) and assume an operations mindset is transferable to BD. In the past 2-years, near- Constant reorganization has gutted BD; about 20-mid-to-senior BD executives (especially in the M&C group) have been summarily fired or just quit. People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management. The annual strategy meetings are an example of kiss-up, kick down. Net-net, the company is losing contracts to its competitors. Again, VNA is an OK place if you want an operations focused career.

I left on my own terms, but I am proud to have always questioned and challenged internal management who tried to keep us quiet - I was tired of always having to push things far enough into the public eye to make a difference. I had to keep a special file of my emails notifying legal or safety of potential issues - doing my job, I was sometimes fearful about what I discovered.;Ageism
PGandE;30/07/2019;-82.13962832747362;At this point in the company it is difficult with limited resources. As a IT Rotational I have noticed that some managers don't know how to use my skills and have had a hard time developing as an engineer if you are not a programmer. Also, can be hard getting a full time offer if the team does not have the money to hire you permanently.;Ageism
PGandE;02/04/2020;-95.62029131089905;If you're not part of the union, you will get the short end of the stick on raises, bonuses, and anything else. They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.;Ageism
PGandE;08/07/2019;-10.843797086891007;All of my observations apply to IT and Cybersecurity only. Average output and work ethic in these groups is extremely low. Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours. Facilities outside of San Francisco are often very basic or even shoddy. If considering a position outside of SF, make sure to tour the work site. Being outside of SF is also a career disadvantage unless your work site is a center for your org.;Ageism

The company lacks controls and accountability and believe me, people take advantage. There are good people but few and far between. Many people do virtually nothing all day long. The company in general talks a big game of ""change"" but utterly unwilling to do so in practice. Status quo rules here, how many times did I hear ""don't rock the boat"". Morale is low, employees are generally unfriendly. Lots of older, legacy staff who still believe the company's modus operandi is that of the 1980's, i.e. telling you not to ask them a question where they have to think and find someone else. A general lack of problem solving ability, will to do so, and execution. You must review safety procedures before every meeting, which gets condescending and repetitive. We are all adults, it should be assumed we know how to climb stairs,etc without instructions how to do so at nauseaum. Rampant nepotism and favoritism. Horrible, decrepit facilities akin to the DMV.

Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.;Ageism

If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no.

Sometimes it seems that the extraneous programs and initiatives are more important to management than being good at your job. The politically correct speech and business politics have taken hold of BP and sometimes you long for the “good ole days” when you could say what you mean and mean what you say. It seems that it is all about CYA (cover you’re a**), there are the expected politics and ole boy club that characterizes the oil field. Sometimes common sense takes a back seat to London or Houston’s whims. Not that they are all bad but sometimes they seem overblown, over engineered, and under thought. Sometimes the company doesn’t have the time or money to do things right the first time, but we will have it either on the second or third time though. ? I have never known any other schedule but I work offshore and my schedule is 14 days on 14 days off and 12 hour days for the 14 days that I am at work, I think that I would like to try something else.

No or minimal work from home was allowed until the COVID-19 pandemic, though employees are back in the office now that the pandemic is perceived as waning. Little diversity in the company, particularly in the upper ranks. The corporate officers, board, and upper management are largely white and male. Exorbitant pay for upper management and officers. Last year, the company laid off 9% of its workforce despite taking $2.1 billion in federal tax benefits meant to cushion the pandemic’s blow to the economy. At the same time, dividends were awarded to shareholders. Minimal meaningful training was provided past initial on-boarding.;Ageism

I was told for myself when Marathon repurchased the st Paul park refinery by the HR professionals from corporate that I would qualify for the retirement health benefits at the time they purchased the refinery. 2 years later I was laid off due to covid and corporate restructuring. the severance package was good but not I hit the lottery. but 3 weeks before I was supposed to start my retirement health plan I receive a letter stating what I needed to do to enroll in the program. the next week I receive another letter saying that I do not qualify for the retirement health care program????? i called HR and was basically told to bad. I called and tried to explain what I was told at the transition and that I had 25+ years with the company.

Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.Advice to ManagementMove the HQ out of Findlay and step into the 21st century with regards to work practices and work/life balance.

ExxonMobil;17/08/2021;-1.386238071320939;"Management sucks. In my 20 years career in XOM I had just few great managers who were developing their personnel. There is lots of politics and brown-nosing. Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same.

It’s just about salary administration”. Flash forward a couple of years and I guess what he meant is administration of no salary upon layoffs of highly capable people. The desire to cling to an early 1900s management philosophy of fear and punishment is driven by those who benefited from this system. The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry. There is a serious lack of vision and an attitude of “don’t worry it will all be fine” as it is clear the ship is sinking!

It truly felt they hired the least qualified people in so many areas of management. Terrible at relationships. Even more terrible with tech. Because they give you the option to ""switch roles ever couple of years"", your first line boss truly determines your future. If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them.

Yes you had to deal with a ranking system that destroyed any attempt of having a collaborative environment, and culture was focused on following procedures and working for complying with internal audits instead of fostering new ideas and teamwork, but working hard was typically rewarded and you could count on a long term career… Everything dramatically changed the last couple of years, ranking system was redesigned to make it easier to place employees at the bottom, you could be a sustained good performer for 5+ years and suddenly end up being offered a 3 lay off package for having had a “bad year”. There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit.

Phillips66;14/08/2020;-98.00602712204922;"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. -The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). -Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". -There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. -The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".Advice to ManagementStop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.6 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Benefits

The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company.

These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

The name of the company was a last minute deal that Phillips management agreed to get controil of the company. Unfortunatly, while the top layer was Phillips personnel, the next layer was alll Conoco Personnel. So if you were in that 3rd tier level and you were a Phillips guy, you might as well forget, once 55 came around, you would not get any salary increases as was told to me separately and if they could think of any reason, you were terminated at age 55 or as soon after..I can provide 15-25 names who left at 55,of who i knew.;Benefits

For example, if you get a promotion in 2012, you would automatically get the standard 3 rating that year. It is very rare to get a 1 or 2 rating two years in a row even if you do the best work. - HR has just as much of a say as your supervisor/director does on when you get promoted. - Promotions are just 6%.

Conocophilips;20/03/2012;-0.5575087895529833;There are many layers of management at ConocoPhillips and that makes it extremely hard to get any work done or to feel any sense of ownership of a role. While it is possible to get a new role and develop professionally at ConocoPhillips, there are a lot of politics at play and there are Talent Management Teams (TMT's) that play a huge role in placing employees in new roles that are not always in the employees best interest and development, it's usually for the benefit of the company. Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees. Most of the poor treatment of employees comes from top management and employees are seen as very expendable.;Benefits
Conocophilips;11/06/2011;-6.192867905575085;The Bartlesville, Oklahoma office houses a sprawling bureaucracy which administers the IT, Finance, and Accounting functions. The culture is extremely risk-averse. The Orwellian office-safety campaign reflects an unwillingness to quantify risk, rather than a sincere commitment to worker safety. The computer systems line employees interface with are 10-20 years out of date. The staffing model, driven by seniority and cronyism, promotes uneducated legacy employees beyond their level of competence. The Tone at the Top, both in corporate management and business unit management, is focused on control, constricting employee autonomy and stifling innovation. Decision making is paralyzed by fear of risk. While the pay is above market, the opportunities are decidedly limited. Any college finance course will teach you that an option is worth money. ConocoPhillips knows this, and pays employees a premium for the options they forgo due to the remote work location and glacial pace of promotions.;Benefits

ConocoPhillips likes to stick with older software platforms and has yet to take the leap to current technologies like GPGPU or even web services. It appears that software we end up supporting/developing has more to do with the person who yells the loudest, rather than what is truly useful or innovative. But, as long as you swim with the current, you'll be fine. Also, the career path for software developers isn't clear at ConocoPhillips, but who cares when you get a sweet benefits package.;Benefits

The culture may have changed, but when I was trying to implement the policies that management should have been implementing there was always push back from management and employees. They hire a lot of family members or friends of friends which also gives others an unfair advantage when it comes to promotions and disciplinary actions. Management definitely has their favorite employees and it shows. Schlumberger forces employees to do 52 stop cards annually which makes the stop cards (RIR) ineffective. I’d rather have quality reports than quantity. Oh and the bonuses are a joke unless you are upper management. It’s like working for a sinking ship when oil prices are down.

You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Benefits

No bonuses for anyone other than the salaried, they brag about record quarterly earnings, you might get a 2.5% ""cost of living adjustment"" if you're lucky. There is no end of year review process, and the departments can do that if they want, however they want, or not at all. You're kept in the dark on most everything, and really are not a part of a workgroup. Required training (CPR, fire extinguisher, etc...) needs to be scheduled by you, and kept up with by you, and if they need you out of town you'll need to reschedule. This often leads to being out of compliance on these, and.... its ON YOU! A culture of fear is how they run the company, every policy has the term ""up to and including termination"" for a reason.

GeneralElectric;26/02/2020;-1.3410346559517805;1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareReportGE ResponseSocial Media ConsultantThank you for sharing.

The company appear to believe that money = satisfaction. If you’re an expat my advice is don’t bother. They simply don’t care about your happiness nor utilising their staff to their full potential. They want to be seen as an ‘employer of choice’, yet when people are keen to contribute to the company and move into new roles they don’t support you at all. I appreciate that there’s a push for Saudization, however the company is losing vital knowledge and real-world experience by not actively engaging many of their expat staff, and we’re treated as being expendable. I can safely say that’s exactly how I’ve been treated. Time to start looking elsewhere… the cons far outweigh the benefits for me at this point.;Benefits

You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.

It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling.

Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;Benefits

Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10?

The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management.

Most managers and engineers refuse to work with contractors and believe they know best regardless of evidence. Company is not very transparent about issues, and cover up is another word for discretion. Most employees are blindsided by the company official attitude since the newspaper is a better source of news than the internal communication. Supervisors are known to berate their employees vs training them. Union vs non-union jobs are set against each other, and engineers are told to not even think about unionizing and to listen to their union peers so they can pass their info up to management. Benefits are mediocre, 401k contribution is the lowest I ever seen in any company, vacation time is not used up and it's loss due to managers not approving on time.

They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.;Benefits
PGandE;08/07/2019;-10.843797086891007;All of my observations apply to IT and Cybersecurity only. Average output and work ethic in these groups is extremely low. Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours.

Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.;Benefits

What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often.7 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Benefits

No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo.

With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.Advice to ManagementYour refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.11 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Opportunities

Duke;01/10/2020;7.105427357601002e-15;"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Opportunities

Imagine your favorite politician ducking a debate question and you have what it looks like when upper leadership answers a question in an ""all-hands"" meeting. - There are many legacy systems that can be extremely hampering to innovation and positive change. - Organizational change seems to comes in waves where we swing from one mode of operation and then back to the next every time upper management changes every 12-18 months. This erodes standard ways of doing work and causes people to fall back on informal channels to get work done (which falls apart completely when someone leaves or changes roles). - Specific issue aligning a tier 2 business that is owned by GE but operates as if its independent.

They promote and encourage employees that they believe are from high society or higher socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs. It's nerve-wracking to work there, never knowing which department they will completely dissolve next.;Opportunities

GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareReportGE ResponseSocial Media ConsultantThank you for sharing.

Aramco;12/09/2021;-3.7820190858864886;1. Locals will be privileged. Expats will go nowhere from their hired positions. 2. Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is. More landmines to get dinged by whenever the umpteenth priority 1 item simply can’t be dealt with in the expected manner - time and qualitatively comprehensively. The priority changes on a daily basis at any given hour sometimes even 2-3 times a day.;Opportunities

If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.

Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.;Opportunities

The transformation to an Agile work environment means staff are deployed on projects and seem to rush to get work done during the sprints. This might lead to the 80% solution becoming the 50% solution. New CEO bernard looney has re-imagined bp by transforming it into a utility company and shrinking oil and gas production 40% by 2030, and even less by 2050. The end result is that if you're a geoscientist and want a career in oil & gas, you should see working at bp as a dead-end and start looking for a new employer. In exploration, every new discovery is another step closer to making your job redundant.

Marathon;21/01/2020;-0.5273731793068777;"The CEO is old fashioned and out of touch. Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"".

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

Duke;01/10/2020;7.105427357601002e-15;"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Privacy

Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;Privacy

As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others.

Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same.

The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry.

It truly felt they hired the least qualified people in so many areas of management. Terrible at relationships. Even more terrible with tech. Because they give you the option to ""switch roles ever couple of years"", your first line boss truly determines your future. If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them.

There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit.

Phillips66;14/08/2020;-98.00602712204922;"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. -The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). -Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". -There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. -The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"". Upper management generally never hires from ""the union"".Advice to ManagementStop hiring temporary workers for shift work. Otherwise, for permanently hired employees the professional expectations due to the necessity of shift work are understandable given the level of pay. But don't be surprised if workers leave. For some, the pay is not worth it.6 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";Resources

The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";Resources

I have seen employees use their company cards for lunch every day of the week as well as company vehicles given to employees that have no need. Instead of making employees move to Charlotte they allow a large number of individuals to travel almost weekly on the company’s dime to Charlotte headquarter. The fleecing is alarming.

Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is.

When they acknowledged my e-mail year 1 is due to incompetence, year 2 (assuming the auditors outliners the issues in year 1 should not occur in year 2.

Repeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: ""If you don't move, you don't matter"". Once you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents.

Chevron;16/11/2018;-99.58814665996985;- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;Resources

The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years.

But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.;Resources

Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.;Resources

DTE;28/01/2016;-1.1099949773982871;Old fashioned company, the majority of employees have been there for a long time, so they don't know things can be better (benefit package is mediocre), no discount on their services to employees, different departments don't communicate well with each other, low starting pay, my experience left me feeling the company is more interested in their community image and reputation rather than making employees feel valued. I don't feel safe working there. There are many visitors, construction contractors and contracted employees there all the time. I couldn't look at a person and immediately tell they were an employee. Parking isn't very secure. There is a great security presence once inside, but it seemed like I worked in a public place (equivalent to an airport). Too many different unions usually mean problem with management and employee relations. Computer system (CSB) should be retired now!Advice to ManagementValue your employees and your employees will value your customers. Empower frontline employees more. When hiring it would be more beneficial to take advantage of new employee's skills vs. being so rigid with the job description. The opposite occurs when there are unions involved, unfortunately. Considering giving CRs the option of working from home. It would make a better work life balance, especially since there is the use of mandatory overtime. Good luck with the new customer system, because the current one is not very user friendly/efficient. Pay frontline employees appropriately (more), since their job is more important than management's (according to management).4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Resources
Marathon;27/06/2021;-34.72626820693119;Typical large corporation with bloated bureaucracy and slow-moving parts. The organization is so big, however, that this ironically varies depending on where you are. Typical virtue signaling when it comes to the issue of the day instead of a principled corporate culture that is not moved by trending controversies.Advice to ManagementThis is certainly not directed at Marathon alone (nearly every big company is similar), but it is scary as an employee to see a company cave into political pressure every time something new comes up since you never know what is coming next in terms of personnel training and virtue signaling, and what may or may not be politically correct on any given day. My advice would be to ignore what's in the news and just focus on running an effective company that serves the world's energy needs.;Resources
Marathon;09/09/2021;-19.39226519337016;Very conservative, old-school company. The corporate headquarters is located in Findlay, Ohio, a fairly long commute to larger metropolitan areas. No or minimal work from home was allowed until the COVID-19 pandemic, though employees are back in the office now that the pandemic is perceived as waning. Little diversity in the company, particularly in the upper ranks. The corporate officers, board, and upper management are largely white and male. Exorbitant pay for upper management and officers. Last year, the company laid off 9% of its workforce despite taking $2.1 billion in federal tax benefits meant to cushion the pandemic’s blow to the economy. At the same time, dividends were awarded to shareholders. Minimal meaningful training was provided past initial on-boarding.;Resources

Marathon;25/09/2021;-78.41788046207934;"forced overtime, Job security (unless in the union), managers talking about employees behind their back. Maintenance department managers show favoritism to employees that truly do not deserve the promotions that were received. I was told for myself when Marathon repurchased the st Paul park refinery by the HR professionals from corporate that I would qualify for the retirement health benefits at the time they purchased the refinery. 2 years later I was laid off due to covid and corporate restructuring. the severance package was good but not I hit the lottery. but 3 weeks before I was supposed to start my retirement health plan I receive a letter stating what I needed to do to enroll in the program. the next week I receive another letter saying that I do not qualify for the retirement health care program????? i called HR and was basically told to bad. I called and tried to explain what I was told at the transition and that I had 25+ years with the company. My advice is if you ever apply for a job there make sure it's part of the union, its is the only way you'll have any job security and you will also get raises.Advice to ManagementThe employees do see all of the mishandling of things that take place in the maintenance department. yet nothing changes, people without the knowledge required are advanced due to being able to BS with the senior management. very poor and unprofessional managerial taking place! example of this during the layoff ""due to covid"" there were about 17 people laid off and a majority of these people were over the age of 50 most with 15+ years of service. I really don't have any idea what there selection process was but the positions that were laid off didn't go away they were just reassigned. from what I have seen Marathon has posted job positions that were supposedly no longer needed during the covid period (which is still here).";Resources

Marathon;02/12/2020;-0.6981416373681526;There are a few good managers, but for the most part they are just a good ole boy network who play the game and pretend to care about the company while they line their pockets and protect only themselves. There is a lot of talk about diversity, but it is just to satisfy the political correctness and everyone just rolls their eyes. They lay off some of the best employees they've ever had, and keep the lazy if they are in the clique. Safety is a banner word, but in reality it is only a matter of time until the truth is discovered in the public eye in the form of a catastrophic event.Advice to ManagementQuit promoting only the people who pretend and can put on the best show, and start being more aware of who actually cares and knows what they are doing. Playing politics and otherwise treating people bad will eventually catch up to you, and your poor leadership skills will be brought to light.3 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;Resources
Marathon;10/11/2020;-54.349573078854846;Definite good old boys club. Promotions are not based on merit or abilities. Age discrimination is running rampant don't plan to retire at this company it's ok to start and learn here but I would plan to move on in your early 40's to avoid any age discrimination issues or unemployment later on in life. This company use to be a decent company with stability until about 5 or 6 years ago when they started to grow and put their total focus on making share holders happy, at that point things started to slowly go down hill. Employees are no longer valued. Management positions are given but in a number of cases decisions are not allowed to be made by the people placed in those positions.
