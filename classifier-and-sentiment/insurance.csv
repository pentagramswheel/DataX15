Not too much micro-management and good level of responsibility/influence for individual contributors.;"More and more, the wrong people are become supervisors without adequate skills and training. Management will defend them to no end while constantly criticizing individual contributors. The amount of rework on small things is outrageous meanwhile critical tasks aren't getting completed due to poor work prioritization from the supervisor. New performance assessments are more of a popularity and personality contest as supervisors fail to understand and give proper credit for real work by employees. People will tell outright lies to try and get their way or put others down. Employee concerns are not properly addressed as the organization only cares about what's coming from the top-down. The individuals who do care aren't are in a position to bring change. Work life balance and flex policies are a joke for most jobs. My coworkers are stressed, frustrated, and running out of patience. Despite all this, management continues to paint things as a pretty picture and will repeatedly talk about culture and ""one team"" and how we should be so excited to be a part of this work. There are way too many managers and too many p***ing contests that results in lack of clarity and constant change in direction for individual contributors. Leadership team is nearly all male and white. Contributions by and perspective from people of color are diminished whereas others are recognized for doing base business job functions.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro amazing colleague decent pace getting new assignment much micro management good level responsibility influence individual contributor con wrong people become supervisor without adequate skill training management defend end constantly criticizing individual contributor amount rework small thing outrageous meanwhile critical task getting completed due poor work prioritization supervisor new performance assessment popularity personality contest supervisor fail understand give proper credit real work employee people tell outright lie try get way put others employee concern properly addressed organization care coming top individual care position bring change work life balance flex policy joke job coworkers stressed frustrated running patience despite management continues paint thing pretty picture repeatedly talk culture one team excited part work way many manager many p ing contest result lack clarity constant change direction individual contributor leadership team nearly male white contribution perspective people color diminished whereas others recognized base business job function person found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.77;-0.8;0.59;0

The company's scapegoat was ""they likely were exposed during their lunch break"" since the exposure could not be ""proven"" to occur during the 12-person meeting in the conference room (note this was before vaccines were rolled out). - Everything is an ""emergency"" in the eyes of management and they will drain your energy preparing for minute issues - Overall lack of diversity that will continue to propagate discriminatory behavior and microaggressions throughout the company - ""This is the way we've always done it, so we will continue doing everything this way"" will get you rewarded rather than challenging the status quo - The CEO and other executives only care about shareholders, never the individual contributors - Town Halls will actively censor messages and questions - ""Management's hands are tied"" is the excuse that is communicated for everything - Roles will continue to be outsourced abroad to save costs, despite the additional complications with timely communications - Management will not admit that they a culture revamp to retain talent - Talent is escaping to industries that better value their employees (i.e. Tech & Consulting), but Exxon will not enhance their benefits package accordingly - Only Chemical Engineering degrees are truly valued in the company. This is a not-so-secret expectation on how to quickly accelerate your career here. - Sustainability initiatives are minimal - In order to be successful, you are required to follow a traditional career path through manufacturing roles - If you do something bad, supervisors will not support you. If you do something good, supervisors will take credit for the work you did. - The expectation is that you need to respond within 24 hours if someone needs you while on vacation - The cultural issues stem throughout the entire company! Not only within one function (i.e. chemicals vs. upstream or supply chain vs. technical) - A supervisor once told me ""the people who do well here take ownership,"" which is ironic considering that the company as a whole has not been taking ownership over its poor culture that has caused top talent to apply elsewhere.11 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro peer make place bearable trauma bonding campus beautiful take froyo break lucky enough one houston site state income tax get learn like oil gas chemical con worst management including supervisor get promoted many micromanagers upper management selective hearing come feedback site beaumont baton rouge worse living chernobyl diverse friendly people leave within first couple year executive like pocketing money lower level employee face minimal salary raise get salary raise lack transparency across board e learn salary freeze k cut layoff etc news outlet younger generation know industry sustainable view exxon evil compared peer communication serious issue e covid blm anti asian rhetoric purely reactive put response employee dissatisfaction working home non essential role option even peer contracted covid company scapegoat likely exposed lunch break since exposure could proven occur person meeting conference room note vaccine rolled everything emergency eye management drain energy preparing minute issue overall lack diversity continue propagate discriminatory behavior microaggressions throughout company way always done continue everything way get rewarded rather challenging status quo ceo executive care shareholder never individual contributor town hall actively censor message question management hand tied excuse communicated everything role continue outsourced abroad save cost despite additional complication timely communication management admit culture revamp retain talent talent escaping industry better value employee e tech consulting exxon enhance benefit package accordingly chemical engineering degree truly valued company secret expectation quickly accelerate career sustainability initiative minimal order successful required follow traditional career path manufacturing role something bad supervisor support something good supervisor take credit work expectation need respond within hour someone need vacation cultural issue stem throughout entire company within one function e chemical v upstream supply chain v technical supervisor told people well take ownership ironic considering company whole taking ownership poor culture caused top talent apply elsewhere people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.75;0.91;0.98;0
ExxonMobil;Limited growth opportunity and rigorous competitive ranking system for all professionals;Good place for experience. Lots of good co-workers. Very diverse and woke culture. Benefits are not excellent like they used to be but are still ok. Good place to be from. Looks great on a resume.;"Opportunities for promotion are limited except for the top 20% of the rank group. Forced, competitive ranking for all professionals, while system is made to look objective is remains highly subject to preferential assignment opportunities, and subjective ranking largely influenced by whether you're in favor with the ranking management. Talent, hard work, amount of work product, quality of work, are not the main determinants of success. Sadly, having the ""right"" corporate appearance and image carry more weight in long-term success than technical or professional skills and production. For most employees, raises are mere cost of living adjustments. The few in the top get the vast lions share of promotions and advancement. The lower half of the rank group will get virtually nothing annually and maybe a one percent raise every 18 months to two years. Notwithstanding the fact that everyone they hire is an academic and professional standout just to get hired in the first place. The company is a morale killer. Stock has not performed and has lost value for over ten years running.

ExxonMobil;It used to be a decent company;I worked in Controllers organization and you will get lot of opportunities to learn the business. I've done financial reporting, operations accounting, process and controls, internal audit. Generally the rotation is about 3 years on average. You can't get bored but you have to learn fast. XOM has great expat policy and have great expat opportunities as well, if you're lucky to get on the list.;"Management sucks. In my 20 years career in XOM I had just few great managers who were developing their personnel. There is lots of politics and brown-nosing. Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same. Salary increase is minimum to none, company match gone (they are going to reinstate it back in October), health plan is expensive, 401K funds are low performers.

ExxonMobil;The company is going down the drain, clearly preparing for a future merger/acquisition with Chevron.;The initial pay is fine. The matching savings plan is coming back for the foreseeable future. It’s a great name on the resume and will take you far. Great way to change companies.;Toxic culture. Toxic supervisors/managers cover for toxic supervisors/managers. The ghost layoffs are masked under the new ranking process to force employees out of the company. A ranking system that is used to layoff employees, particularly those new, older age or with the company for over 10 years. Compensation does not keep up with inflation or cost of living. Be prepared to deal with HR incompetence when trying to get a straight answer about ranking results. Company is a house of cards that will not change with the times/move swiftly like tech companies for example. It’s an imploding dinosaur. First and second line supervisors are not screened properly. Which is why the company becomes a breeding ground for a toxic micro cultures all across the company, up to the very top. There’s great managers out there but they usually can’t do much to stop the fires or poison seeping to other areas of the company. It’s a sad story. Once mighty Exxon, it has become a sad story of fallen giant. Its internal culture is a mirror image of the public’s toxic perception of the company. People should continue leaving. Other companies pay better and promote employees all throughout their career.15 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro initial pay fine matching saving plan coming back foreseeable future great name resume take far great way change company con toxic culture toxic supervisor manager cover toxic supervisor manager ghost layoff masked new ranking process force employee company ranking system used layoff employee particularly new older age company year compensation keep inflation cost living prepared deal hr incompetence trying get straight answer ranking result company house card change time move swiftly like tech company example imploding dinosaur first second line supervisor screened properly company becomes breeding ground toxic micro culture across company top great manager usually much stop fire poison seeping area company sad story mighty exxon become sad story fallen giant internal culture mirror image public toxic perception company people continue leaving company pay better promote employee throughout career people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.86;-0.87;0.69;0

It’s just about salary administration”. Flash forward a couple of years and I guess what he meant is administration of no salary upon layoffs of highly capable people. The desire to cling to an early 1900s management philosophy of fear and punishment is driven by those who benefited from this system. The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry. There is a serious lack of vision and an attitude of “don’t worry it will all be fine” as it is clear the ship is sinking! I implore anyone considering hiring on to at least look at the stock price over the last 5 years. After recovering from COVID lows the downward trend is right where it has been for that period.

ExxonMobil;The Most Toxic Environment;The other new hires were fun to work with. Some brilliant minds to work besides Decent starting pay for software Food on Spring Campus is good;"If it was possible, I would publish a 500 page paper on why not to work at ExxonMobil if you're in tech. Top 4: 1) Management is a joke. It truly felt they hired the least qualified people in so many areas of management. Terrible at relationships. Even more terrible with tech. Because they give you the option to ""switch roles ever couple of years"", your first line boss truly determines your future. If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them. I could hear my ranking slowly go down every time I asked to work from home.12 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro new hire fun work brilliant mind work besides decent starting pay software food spring campus good con possible would publish page paper work exxonmobil tech top management joke truly felt hired least qualified people many area management terrible relationship even terrible tech give option switch role ever couple year first line bos truly determines future first bos like review poorly say goodbye career good boss extremely outnumbered wasting budget many team went agile training truly embarrassing see exxon get swindled paying long term engagement something take group couple week get nailed ranking rebranded still draconic ranking system encourage people work together give credit due end day ensuring ranking high enough work home policy role require office equipment purpose software part one could hear ranking slowly go every time asked work home people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.86;0.62;0.97;0

ExxonMobil;Sad to see it going downhill as a workplace like this;Pay remains somewhat competitive Bright and talented people still works here;This used to be a good to place to work, not the greatest company for innovation, creativity or teamwork but the trade off was a stable “hire to retire” culture with solid business fundamentals, focus on safety and the chance of working with experienced and solid professionals. Yes you had to deal with a ranking system that destroyed any attempt of having a collaborative environment, and culture was focused on following procedures and working for complying with internal audits instead of fostering new ideas and teamwork, but working hard was typically rewarded and you could count on a long term career… Everything dramatically changed the last couple of years, ranking system was redesigned to make it easier to place employees at the bottom, you could be a sustained good performer for 5+ years and suddenly end up being offered a 3 lay off package for having had a “bad year”. There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit. This has been a fundamental shift away from what used to be company core values, and a real shame. Unless this is your only option, I would discourage anyone to join EM at the moment.18 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro pay remains somewhat competitive bright talented people still work con used good place work greatest company innovation creativity teamwork trade stable hire retire culture solid business fundamental focus safety chance working experienced solid professional yes deal ranking system destroyed attempt collaborative environment culture focused following procedure working complying internal audit instead fostering new idea teamwork working hard typically rewarded could count long term career everything dramatically changed last couple year ranking system redesigned make easier place employee bottom could sustained good performer year suddenly end offered lay package bad year layoff across function affiliate company demanded employee return office back early may pandemic still peak environment became toxic morale lowest key benefit also took hit fundamental shift away used company core value real shame unless option would discourage anyone join em moment people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.71;0.97;0.98;0

People being hired in many of these locations do not have the same dedication to the company and realize that they make less so when you get a supervisor or manager from one of these countries when you work in the USA expect resentment. The management in the USA talked for years that people were hired for a career from college to retirement but they have pushed people out by increasing poor performers to as high as 10% in some years to avoid paying layoff packages. The company forced many people to retire. The company cares about employees only if they are cheap to pay. Early in a person's career they are identified to be a top performer and after that time you can fall from being a top performer but it is almost impossible to get into the top rankings each year once the company has decided your career level in your first few years at the company.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro opportunity work large project people world travel often allows stay star hotel generous food allowance corporate department imagine large company sometimes person move department manager support varied assignment career company potential make lot money price oil rise money may return employee higher raise increased training opportunity con job cut europe canada singapore usa move job location cost cheaper people hired many location dedication company realize make le get supervisor manager one country work usa expect resentment management usa talked year people hired career college retirement pushed people increasing poor performer high year avoid paying layoff package company forced many people retire company care employee cheap pay early person career identified top performer time fall top performer almost impossible get top ranking year company decided career level first year company people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.91;-0.67;0.75;0

Two of the supervisors and the lab manager are toxic to those that work under them, patronizing when honest feedback is given, and then act shocked when new hires and contractors don't last six months before moving on to better positions at other companies. Almost all benefits were cut last year while the company shareholder dividend was maintained, and no raises were given out. There is extremely low morale, but with current leadership, it is being ignored rather than addressed. Claims of the utmost focus on quality go out the window when production metrics are threatened. Constantly short-staffed due to high turnover rate (because of excessively low morale). Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for lab work; this facility is a dead end.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro pay decent take work home con job mind numbingly simple routine two supervisor lab manager toxic work patronizing honest feedback given act shocked new hire contractor last six month moving better position company almost benefit cut last year company shareholder dividend maintained raise given extremely low morale current leadership ignored rather addressed claim utmost focus quality go window production metric threatened constantly short staffed due high turnover rate excessively low morale would highly recommend look elsewhere lab work facility dead end people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;-0.1;-0.91;-0.8;0

The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy. Finally, the brand is toxic and the company knows it.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro good pay healthcare benefit pension last colleague generally intelligent motivated pleasant work end working interesting project training used good dropped last year first line supervisor mixed generally good experience con upper management detached reactive apparently incompetent culture top employee expected defer frankly live awe position authority detriment organization since upper management typically develops distorted view actual operation related note management frequently seems ignore recommendation technical staff em used offer relative career stability company oil gas industry window especially employee high cost location usa australia canada western europe layoff high cost region handled poorly starting mandated cut gaming performance management system greatly eroded internal organizational trust already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition result performance management ranking system always bad gotten worse time especially lately em definitely wrong side history though likely long term future oil gas level industry probably precipice long term contraction renewable energy grows ioc especially xom particularly vulnerable especially current management company strategy finally brand toxic company know people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.92;-0.92;0.82;0

ExxonMobil;Great Pay but they make you Pay for it;The pay is fantastic, flexible hours, great health benefits;As a Person of Color, my time with ExxonMobil was quite stressful. Most of the people are great to work with but supervisors are mostly micromanagers, diversity is not their strongest suit. Lots of white males in upper management. Too much discrimination at the workplace, sutle but it's there. Some of the operators won't like you because you're a young engineer coming in to tell them how to do their job, it takes time and patience to build a connection with them but overall great people to work with. Lots of fake people go behind your back to talk bad about you. Work hours can be crazy, it's part of the job description that you have your work phone with you 24/7. Anyone at the plant can contact you so say bye to Work-Life balance. If you do have a doctor's appt. or so you can get time off or be allowed to come to work late, supervisors do differ. Work hours can be long, when you're new it's expected you're at the plant later than everyone getting to know your unit and operators. ExxonMobil has a ranking system every year to discuss your performance but if your supervisor doesn't like you, you won't have someone to defend your work and speak for you.

Phillips66;Some great people but the company/job is not for everyone;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.-Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below)-Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.-wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn-It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.-Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.";"-A lot of tension and drama between the workers union and management. -The refinery never stops except in the case of an extreme natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane). Otherwise, if there is a snowstorm or blizzard, be prepared to sleep on a cot and stay at the refinery (forget about your family at home). -Shift work. Unless you are one of the rare positions which do not require shift work (i.e. engineering, office work, supervisor, management). Otherwise most of the workers on site are required to work rotating Day/Night shifts. If you work as an operator, a laboratory technician, or any skilled worker (plumber, electrician) then it is shift work. Most of the jobs which allow the oil refinery to run continuously 24/7 are shift work jobs. Did I mention that this job has shift work?-Precarious work/life balance for shift workers. The refinery must run 24/7, no questions asked. This means if you are a shift worker there are no ""holidays"" in a traditional sense. Your schedule is a 14 day pattern that repeats until you retire or leave. The schedule is generally: two days on, two days off, three days on, two days off, two days on, three days off, repeat. If your schedule says you work on Christmas eve, then you are working on Christmas eve. If your schedule says you are working on a wedding or birth of a child or other important event, you are working unless you use a vacation day. Which brings me to the next point...-You can be forced to work. If you are a union employee, part of the contract you sign is an agreement to be ""forced"" to work. Yes, there is paid vacation for permanent employees (but not for temp workers, more on that below). When you take a paid vacation, other people must cover your shift. But sometimes, due to the rotating shift schedule, only a small handful of workers can actually cover that shift, and if there are any schedule conflicts then the company resorts to a ""force list"" to FORCE you to work. If somebody calls out, you can be FORCED to go to work. There is a ""force list"" and every worker trained for that same role gets put on the list. When a shift needs to be ""forced"" on someone, they get bumped down in priority on the force list, so the next person who hasn't been ""forced"" in awhile will be ""forced"" next. Scheduled an appointment? Nope, sorry you have to come in. Groomsman or bridesmaid? Better cross your fingers and hope that the day of the wedding you don't get a phone call that you have to come in. Caveat: if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and/or manager/supervisor they are often more than willing to work around this. I was lucky to work with a team where we tried to make sure nobody got forced to come in if they had important events. However the rules are the rules and there is always the possibility you have to be forced to come in once it is ""your turn"". -There is a constant paranoia of being called in to work, even on your ""days off"". The only way to be 99% certain that you will not be called in to work is to take a vacation day, and even then...emergencies happen and you may be called in.-It can feel like a ""golden cage"". It is exceedingly difficult to find equivalent pay for the same position outside of the oil refinery. So the retention rate is high if you are hired directly as a permanent employee. Many people stay for 20-30+ years. Almost everyone stays for the pay and the stability of working in a union. However many years of shift work can take a psychological and emotional toll on some people. Some people can be very (justifiably) jaded after 25+ years. -The high pay means upper management expects all of the above is ""par for the course"". AKA ""You signed up for this, take it or leave it""-If you are hired as a temporary worker via contracting agency, you are expected to work the same hours and perform the same tasks as a permanently hired Phillips 66 employee. This may have changed since I left but during my tenure at the company, I was originally hired as a temporary worker and I was expected to work the same job, the same shifts, and be on the same ""force list"" as the union workers. Some temps have worked 2+ years before being hired. It is the worst of both worlds. You don't get the pay, vacation, or benefits (insurance, retirement etc.) of a permanent employee, yet you suffer all of the negatives of the shift work.-Virtually no upward mobility. Especially if you join the union. Yes, there is a payscale progression, but once you are in the union that's it. You are an operator/Technician for life. You can maybe be a production supervisor someday but that's about it as far as ""upward mobility"".

Phillips66;Very Old School, Siloed, and Dysfunctional;Benefits are good and above average. Good office building.;"As an experienced hire, new views were not welcomed. The company is far behind the industry in my discipline which I was hired to help, but in the end that help was actually not wanted. The supervision wants everyone in the office everyday so they can ""make sure they are working"" as quoted by my supervisor. No remote working here even though I had a corporate job with all the refineries. There is a general lack of trust in making decisions, management can and will overrule without seeking to understand the details and ""gut feel"" - this makes their risk higher than many organizations. Decisions are hierarchical so it takes forever to decide on many simple concepts and plans. Long term strategies to improve are non-existent, only ""keep it running today"". Without longer term vision and goals, it is demoralizing to work there. At the end I was sad I could not help and advise others looking to hire on that unless they need the good benefits, long-term self-growth is nil unless you are friends with those in high places.Advice to ManagementBe open to ideas that others bring into your organization. Help them be successful instead of challenging and backstabbing things to make you look better. Actually act on a long term vision, not just show PowerPoints and do nothing of substance to achieve them. Value the experience and decisions new people bring in - you might be missing something in your own organization. Work as a company to achieve the long term improvement goals, not just let each refinery decide on its own what and how to do improve in its own silo. It would be beneficial if the VP level talked with senior staff directly more to understand some of the dysfunctional problems in the management level between them and senior support staff. They might find out what is working and not working more.4 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro benefit good average good office building con experienced hire new view welcomed company far behind industry discipline hired help end help actually wanted supervision want everyone office everyday make sure working quoted supervisor remote working even though corporate job refinery general lack trust making decision management overrule without seeking understand detail gut feel make risk higher many organization decision hierarchical take forever decide many simple concept plan long term strategy improve non existent keep running today without longer term vision goal demoralizing work end sad could help advise others looking hire unless need good benefit long term self growth nil unless friend high place advice managementbe open idea others bring organization help successful instead challenging backstabbing thing make look better actually act long term vision show powerpoints nothing substance achieve value experience decision new people bring might missing something organization work company achieve long term improvement goal let refinery decide improve silo would beneficial vp level talked senior staff directly understand dysfunctional problem management level senior support staff might find working working people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.81;0.99;0.99;0

Phillips66;Don't work here unless you want to put yourself at risk for Covid-19;Work life balance and somewhat job security;"This company is stuck in the 1960s and refuses to adapt to the times for some reason. With Covid-19, employees started working from home with no issues, but leadership forced all employees to come back in the office starting on May 4th. The CEO's reasoning was that employees are more productive and have extra ""creativity"" while in the office, which is simply not true. Now Covid counts are rising in the office and leadership is not being transparent or requiring quarantines even for employees that work in the same pods as their Covid positive coworkers. Also Phillips 66 remains one of the only oil and gas companies (and companies period) that is fully back in the office. Other peer companies reversed their return to work plans once Covid cases started rising in Houston. This is ironic since one of Phillips 66's core values is ""safety"" but they clearly don't care about the safety of their employees.There is also a lack of development opportunities past the early career phase, a lack of diversity especially in leadership (just google the executive team and board of directors), and dysfunctional, disjointed operations across the refineries and corporate offices.Advice to ManagementYour refusal to adapt to the times (putting your employees health at risk, lack of a remote/flexible work policy, and lack of diversity) is going to cost you your current talent and will cause you to not be able to attract new, young talent that you will need to sustain your company.11 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro work life balance somewhat job security con company stuck refuse adapt time reason covid employee started working home issue leadership forced employee come back office starting may th ceo reasoning employee productive extra creativity office simply true covid count rising office leadership transparent requiring quarantine even employee work pod covid positive coworkers also phillips remains one oil gas company company period fully back office peer company reversed return work plan covid case started rising houston ironic since one phillips core value safety clearly care safety employee also lack development opportunity past early career phase lack diversity especially leadership google executive team board director dysfunctional disjointed operation across refinery corporate office advice managementyour refusal adapt time putting employee health risk lack remote flexible work policy lack diversity going cost current talent cause able attract new young talent need sustain company people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.28;0.86;0.95;0

You may support an incident in the middle of the night or weekend with a 8-12 hour window without compensation. There's a few jobs that senior employees can do outside of Corp HQ but those opportunities are only provided a few select key males. Males seem to be promoted more readily than females with similar skill sets. Also, although there are more and more female employees in technical roles I won't share my job title or location. I can easily figure out who posted review for other locations since there aren't that many females in Tech roles.Advice to ManagementTry to be competitive with not only O&G industry but other industries.

Phillips66;Good start;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.";"Limited vacation time (usually 10 days), but the company does have 10 dedicated holidays (Christmas, etc). Also, some jobs are eligible for the ""19/30"" program, which gives you an extra day off each moth so long as you work 8.5 hours per day (instead of 8 - up to you if you'd want to do that in any given month).Advice to ManagementDon't do away with the long-term benefits like the pension system; it's what brings good people in and keeps them around.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor";pro compensation package exceptional base salary may par google additional benefit add fast bonus usually often better base stock option restricted stock unit rsus awarded twice year target varies long company well target usually exceeded company offer dollar dollar match k contribution worth base salary outrageously high private sector top p white rhino private sector benefit pension vest year company additionally pension plan includes stock option called success share dropped retirement account based overall performance business altogether financial benefit easily valued base salary longer stay better get exception refinery new jersey california office facility relatively low tax low cost living location especially hq texas state personal income tax since company situated midstream pipeline downstream refinery retail segment energy industry stock price heavily dependent price oil company take oil gas sends back new product taking relatively consistent margin time protects firm value therefore value rsus market volatility yes company love talk employee centric culture back comping people fairly well kind chatter heard place always sounded hollow sole benefit something like match k con limited vacation time usually day company dedicated holiday christmas etc also job eligible program give extra day moth long work hour per day instead want given month advice managementdon away long term benefit like pension system brings good people keep around people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;1.0;0.96;1.0;0

Conocophilips;Oil and Gas Exploration;"The company has strong heritage assets, and may kind caring people. There are many smart talented people. However, overarching corporate vision and smart business decision making are lacking. The work scheduling with every other friday off schedule is fantastic. I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff. Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.";"Politics, bureaucracy, bloated, games. Let me give a disclaimer that I was laid off. While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills.

He paid too much for assets (he preferred to by oil & gas reserves since he couldn't find any), ran off talented middle & senior level management, dis-incentivized the organic development of new assets (hasn't found any new oil in 16 years), developed no deepwater capabilities, alienated petroleum engineers and geologists, kept investment strategy secret (even to his own staff), sold off valuable assets, kept lousy assets despite good offers and split the integrated company right before the inevitable cyclical downturn of the oil & gas industry.

Promotions are on a strict time-in-grade and performance rating schedule, so for a strong performer it can be a lot of years between promotions. This makes it very dificult to have a strong career at the company unless you are a favorite of the TMT's or have a strong supporter in management. The norm is to have very weak/poor supervisors or managers. They are working supervisors so they don't have the time, energy or interest in developing employees. Most of the poor treatment of employees comes from top management and employees are seen as very expendable.;pro conocophillips work group work life balance pretty good need time vacation sick supervisor usually understanding benefit health vision perscription good big push toward wellness physical mental nice gym facility main complex lot outside program get involved rodeo run united way employee network con many layer management conocophillips make extremely hard get work done feel sense ownership role possible get new role develop professionally conocophillips lot politics play talent management team tmt play huge role placing employee new role always employee best interest development usually benefit company promotion strict time grade performance rating schedule strong performer lot year promotion make dificult strong career company unless favorite tmt strong supporter management norm weak poor supervisor manager working supervisor time energy interest developing employee poor treatment employee come top management employee seen expendable;0.96;0.99;0.99;0

Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind. It offers great work life balance. It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well. Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.;Valero is a conservative company.

Duke;Ready to be nothing more than a glorified retail worker? This place is for you!;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.";"You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the ""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word ""customer"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. - Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual ""silo"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con... - Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as ""when will the service to the house get turned on""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people. - Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of ""customer service"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project/work order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. - Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering ""OWNS"" the work order/project from the company's favorite quote ""cradle to grave"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24/7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling/construction, funky software, babysitting the needy/greedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. - Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a ""fireside chat"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. -Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy/process change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision/apartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects/work orders. The Standards group and management/HR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. -Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction/maintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? ""The Budget"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? ""The Budget"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of ""The Budget"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the ""Budget"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving ""The Budget"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have ""The Budget"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a ""possible"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. - Extreme focus on ""CUSTOMER SERVICE"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the ""customer focus"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout ""customer service"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point... - No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how ""you could've done better"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the ""customer is always right"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con... - Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely ""rushed"" and designed/installed the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it ""cradle to grave"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before... - Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed 2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate 3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done 4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms. - Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is ""committed"" to ""customer service"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public/external clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails/automatic email replies saying ""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. - Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order/project that may seem illogical, ""clicking too fast"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. - Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family/life obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. - Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role/department without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming ""the other candidate had more experience"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of... - Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. - HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. There is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.";pro review engineering within distribution transmission nuclear etc need worry ever real issue

Instead of making employees move to Charlotte they allow a large number of individuals to travel almost weekly on the company’s dime to Charlotte headquarter. The fleecing is alarming.

Shell;Mixed Review - Experience will vary;Very high pay compared to other engineering jobs. Starting salary was 50% higher out of college than average starting salary for someone with an engineering degree. Bonus is good (when we get one). Great relocation benefits when the company asks you to move. Work-life balance can be good depending on your role.;Strange company culture. The company expects employees to work for them forever. Company expects 100% loyalty, but doesn't offer it in return. Talking about anything outside the company is taboo, whether it is an idea that originated from outside the company, part-time continuing education at a university, or future career plans. Company offers tuition reimbursement as a benefit, but there never seems to be budget for it and you're always told it won't help your career and there are plenty of internal trainings to take. Company moved IT and HR to an offshore call center. Anytime you need to talk to someone from HR or IT you need to call a 1800 number and get put on hold for hours and then receive poor customer service. The company's back office financial department is a mess. Nobody knows how to get invoices paid on time or bill from one department to another. Promotions are based on years with the company (they don't really care if you had 10 year of experience at another company before joining the company), internal certifications that mean nothing outside of the company, and who you know. Company expects you to relocate with your family every few years. I've seen this destroy families.

Shell used skype (like many use Zoom) for you to show your online status (offline, away, in a meeting, etc.). Managers would use your online status to gauge how ""good"" of an employee you were. I was warned/counseled by my upper management because they noticed my online status had been ""away"" 3 times in a day for 20 mins each time and to them that was unacceptable. Diversity and Inclusion is not a top priority. If your last name did not start with ""Van something"" or you are not Dutch, forget about climbing the corporate ladder there.

Shell;IT Innovation at Retaliation;Company was extremely committed to ethics, the environment, innovation and betterment of it's people and community most of the time I worked there. Something has changed.;"I was informed, during a two year extreme harassment and ""online shame"" campaign, formal retaliation has been taking place by the IT department through vendors and strategic recruiters/IT contingent workforce suppliers. The attackers claimed I had reported a boss for ""harassment"" (implying sexual harassment). I had made a report about a boss changing names on important documents. It handled well by the company at the time. I wound up leaving the company a year later, definitely NOT because I was pushed out, but because it was time to stretch after 15 years. What I found out really happened was systematic blacklisting at new jobs by IT leaders on a reactive and false premise that I had made a harassment claim to the company. I recall the benevolent warning from a contractor (military background) working with security risk teams about Shell using the vendors and third party partners to do the blacklisting. This ultimately became true, yet it also indicates the IT security and risk organizations are well aware of what they are doing by using category /suppliers this way.One recruiter tried to negotiate my salary down WELL below market value, while two organizations were just odd I had worked with and I wondered why the tone had changed suddenly to very hostile.Advice to ManagementConsider the chilling effect of retaliation which can result in individuals not making the right reports about ethics and safety issues. Further training for IT management on anti-retaliation policy. In depth review of the practices of the IT strategic recruiters, information security information sharing consortiums, and suppliers /consulting firms regarding both their privacy (I was digitally stalked) and anti-retaliation practices.

Inspect all pneumatic tubing, reverse engineer faulty designs, set up control valves, both gas and liquid with NO TRAINING!!! It had better work, or it's your but t. Do multiple tasks with liability on you, with little to no support from ""management"" and you'll probably fail. Then you will be fired. They are required to provide you with ppe. After two years, never received my electrical gloves. Got tired of asking. At first, they cost too much money. Then they forgot. This department is a disaster you will REGRET. they have zero leadership and are 100% looking out for thier golden ladder. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY!!!!. Can't believe I left a decent job at p 66 for this sham. I wanna go back to my I&E job. Enterprise is all about the$$$$$$$$$$$ to those up top. Everyone else is disposable. No bonuses for anyone other than the salaried, they brag about record quarterly earnings, you might get a 2.5% ""cost of living adjustment"" if you're lucky. There is no end of year review process, and the departments can do that if they want, however they want, or not at all. You're kept in the dark on most everything, and really are not a part of a workgroup. Required training (CPR, fire extinguisher, etc...) needs to be scheduled by you, and kept up with by you, and if they need you out of town you'll need to reschedule. This often leads to being out of compliance on these, and.... its ON YOU! A culture of fear is how they run the company, every policy has the term ""up to and including termination"" for a reason.

This erodes standard ways of doing work and causes people to fall back on informal channels to get work done (which falls apart completely when someone leaves or changes roles). - Specific issue aligning a tier 2 business that is owned by GE but operates as if its independent.

There are islands of excellent SW Development teams and to be a part of those is really fun but those are quite segregated and the leadership might not be in the same mindset. Hence, if your passion is in SW development, you may be better off focusing on an SW-product-driven company.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro great company part outstanding culture feel indeed large global great reasonable leadership relatively competitive pay feel much le stressful retail telecom business large piece business slowdown weekend major holiday company continues path continuous improvement refining focus top line business etc con sw dev processional probably good know company actually industrial rather sw development oriented operational excellence focus island excellent sw development team part really fun quite segregated leadership might mindset hence passion sw development may better focusing sw product driven company person found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.95;0.94;0.99;0

Those employees run the company, everyone else works for those employees. They are only open to ideas that come from those elite select employees. They usually only hire people into their early development leadership programs (for candidates straight out of elite universities) and then groom a select few from there. This elitist hierarchy is what causes the financial decline they currently face. It creates an environment that encourages illusion and discourages honest decision-making. All of this makes it quite difficult for people of color to grow and succeed, unless of course they too are from an elite socio-economic background. Finally, there are a lot of layoffs.

GeneralElectric;Join a career accelerating program;1. Unlimited PTO, you just have to get it approve by your manager. 2. In most offices (if not all), have a relaxed dress code. Not having to dress in business casual is a bigger deal than you may think. It would be hard for me to work with a company that doesn't have a relaxed dress code now. 3. Great work flexibility;1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3.

Aramco;Burn(ing) out;1. Good salary 2. Ample vacation time (especially if your coming from America) 3. Job security (if your a Saudi) I’m not an expat but I would say aramco is pretty great for late career expats.;1. Locals will be privileged. Expats will go nowhere from their hired positions. 2. Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America.

Aramco;Saudi Aramco in Dhahran;A pleasing community to live in camp. Pleasantville Arizona... Don't rely on getting across to Bahrain easily, as so are 40,000 others - and it really doesn't have much to offer. Lot's of interesting projects to work on, with very nice Saudis. Warm and pleasant, humorful and non-judgmental. Surrounded by well educated and generally pleasant colleagues from all over the world, who have a great community social life. Everything is only 5 minutes away if you live in camp. Opportunities abound for those who are willing to be agile, productive and positive. A good and surprisingly large hospital, in the camp. Many excellent Saudi staff, surgeons etc.;"Many people will arrive on there first day at work to be told that they don't have the role they've been contacted for. Bit frustrating after a year to get gain the position and actually get there. Managers move around and the info doesn't always get to the replacement. You still get paid though. If your managers really don't want you after you have arrived, they may play the 'don't give her any work' game. Then as you have been sitting around twiddling your thumbs they'll call you in on your 90th day and tell you that you've failed probation because you haven performed, so go home again and pack. Managers often can't make decisions and don't read for more than 30 seconds - which may mean a shift in your expectations - or you can just allow it to irritate you; or you can just carry on and smile. The camp families tend to be a bit cliquey, so if you don't fit their social circle you could be politely avoided. Specific religious beliefs, married or single, that kind of clique. Don't expect a reference when you leave - they just don't give you one, unless you personally request from a friendly manager. It's difficult to come back into the real world if you have been there for 5 years or more, as your overseas experience will be probably ignored by recruiters.";pro pleasing community live camp pleasantville arizona rely getting across bahrain easily others really much offer lot interesting project work nice saudi warm pleasant humorful non judgmental surrounded well educated generally pleasant colleague world great community social life everything minute away live camp opportunity abound willing agile productive positive good surprisingly large hospital camp many excellent saudi staff surgeon etc con many people arrive first day work told role contacted bit frustrating year get gain position actually get manager move around info always get replacement still get paid though manager really want arrived may play give work game sitting around twiddling thumb call th day tell failed probation performed go home pack manager often make decision read second may mean shift expectation allow irritate carry smile camp family tend bit cliquey fit social circle could politely avoided specific religious belief married single kind clique expect reference leave give one unless personally request friendly manager difficult come back real world year overseas experience probably ignored recruiter;0.99;-0.68;0.99;0

A lot of good expatriates come in being honest but you eventually start committing fraud to the terms of millions of dollars of ill gotten gains. When I took proof of this and filed the report with internal audit personally their response was to write it off to lack of Saudi experience. Amazingly when the auditors followed up with me three years in a row about the same issues that I delineated point by point in an e-mail with attached proof I finally gave up. When they acknowledged my e-mail year 1 is due to incompetence, year 2 (assuming the auditors outliners the issues in year 1 should not occur in year 2. If the same issues occur in year 3 & 4 that clearly tells you everything you need to know. From a career perspective there is literally zero growth whatsoever. Long story short stay away it’s not worth the sacrifice unless you’re exactly 49.5 years old and can arrive for day 1 prior to 50. If you can hang on for 10 years and you’ll leave with roughly $2.5MM USD in post tax savings and healthcare for life at about $400 / month for you and your spouse.

Chevron;bureaucratic mess, good benefits;Decent salary and good benefits. People are generally nice. Can be really cushy if you're OK just doing the minimum to get a good review/bonus. I think the happiest people are the ones who find a sweet spot and ride things out for a long period (long-term benefits are great).;We're in a slowly dying industry and lack a clear direction forward. This is reflected in our inability to attract and retain talent from top universities. Think to yourself, why would an engineer from Stanford go to Chevron instead of a tech firm? Internally, we have an exhausting bureaucracy that is highly political and difficult to navigate. At the heart, this is an engineering company, and it is presumed that engineers can do anything. In an era of changing dynamics and enormous pressure from investors and policymakers to move away from fossil fuels, the old school engineer mentality could end up being our downfall. If you're not an engineer (i.e., you're a market analyst, economist, climate person) I'd recommend staying away--you're career path will likely be limited here, and you'll be frustrated by the slow pace, extra work to deal with enormous overhead, and lack of clarity on our goals.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro decent salary good benefit people generally nice really cushy ok minimum get good review bonus think happiest people one find sweet spot ride thing long period long term benefit great con slowly dying industry lack clear direction forward reflected inability attract retain talent top university think would engineer stanford go chevron instead tech firm internally exhausting bureaucracy highly political difficult navigate heart engineering company presumed engineer anything era changing dynamic enormous pressure investor policymakers move away fossil fuel old school engineer mentality could end downfall engineer e market analyst economist climate person recommend staying away career path likely limited frustrated slow pace extra work deal enormous overhead lack clarity goal person found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.98;0.15;0.99;0

I used to love working for Chevron, but now I’m just trying to hang on until retirement. Constant downsizing has destroyed the previous collaborative culture. It is now a dog eat dog company. Politics rule all decisions. Personnel decisions are based on favoritism and cliques. If you do not have a powerful sponsor, prepare for a lousy job or a target on your back for the next downsizing. The focus is on cost cutting and improving the bottom line. This is a declining industry and management has not made any meaningful changes to embrace a lower-carbon future. If you are in any service function your job will be automated or outsourced to Philippines or Argentina. If you are a petrotech, it’s still not too bad, but if you have a long career left, get out of O&G. Retrain yourself. We are coming through a massive downsizing and will probably have another in less than two years.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro general benefit pretty good company focus safety fairly good work life balance constant downsizing eroded company many employee network improve employee experience company trying take care thousand employee laid con hate say avoid company like plague used love working chevron trying hang retirement constant downsizing destroyed previous collaborative culture dog eat dog company politics rule decision personnel decision based favoritism clique powerful sponsor prepare lousy job target back next downsizing focus cost cutting improving bottom line declining industry management made meaningful change embrace lower carbon future service function job automated outsourced philippine argentina petrotech still bad long career left get g retrain coming massive downsizing probably another le two year people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.94;0.28;0.96;0

Chevron;Definitely a good place to start a career...;For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.;"Weak opportunities for non-engineers. If you aren't an engineer, expect to spend your career mostly in the same place and at best climbing the ladder only one or two rungs. Repeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: ""If you don't move, you don't matter"". Once you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents. Under CEO Mike Wirth, Chevron has gone all-in on ""woke"" politics, in an especially ham-fisted way. If you aren't inclined towards PC culture, you'll need to learn to fake it or at least stay very silent. Race and gender are increasingly major factors in hiring and promotion, which may or may not benefit you.";pro chemical mechanical engineer get fully use education entry level pay strong versus competitor work challenging developmental opportunity robust fact executive managed climb ladder rank engineer theoretically make top employee investment front loaded towards new hire term technical training well business acumen training bonus good chevron still pension increasingly atypical employer day opportunity develop skill valuable outside chevron take advantage data science lean sigma program underutilized make valuable outside lumbering dinosaur oil gas con weak opportunity non engineer engineer expect spend career mostly place best climbing ladder one two rung repeated relocation expected anyone want climb ladder married someone gainfully employed outside chevron otherwise positioned relocate every year go nowhere long run saying move matter reach mid career opportunity become limited training development really intended help flagged high potential rare probably stagnate current position within narrow set position mean asking raise get term annual pay increase determined corporate performance rather often make worthwhile employee year experience go elsewhere pay increase substantial confident talent ceo mike wirth chevron gone woke politics especially ham fisted way inclined towards pc culture need learn fake least stay silent race gender increasingly major factor hiring promotion may may benefit;0.98;0.94;0.99;0

It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling.

Chevron;Chevron Stations is one of the worst places to work. Get experience when working here, then leave to get a better job.;First off, Chevron Stations and other departments of Chevron should be separated because they are not the same. Chevron Stations is overloaded with low salary people who slack off during work, and who don't care about their jobs. - Can slack off and do nothing while getting paid, because the managers themselves slack off themselves and let others to do so as well. - Can break practically any rule of Chevron that you want because the managers don't care if you do so or not because they don't care for the company. - Free fountain drinks.;- Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well.;pro first chevron station department chevron separated chevron station overloaded low salary people slack work care job slack nothing getting paid manager slack let others well break practically rule chevron want manager care care company free fountain drink con management chevron corporate allow harassment employee nothing happen report management ruled people geds one barely passed high school thus management chevron low intelligence management care job salary low start finish start making exactly minimum wage increase cent every year capping dollar minimum wage hard coworker management corporate make work others allowed slack basically work others get paid nothing end work well oregon pump gas pump gas well fast made pump gas forever harder work working inside store practically one like pumping gas like people working people inside store talking pump gas alone outside handling gas pump management huge slacker one stayed inside office cell phone day management talk get angry get customer complaint completely ignore customer complaint corporate care even say pile replaceable trash easily replace guy desperate job like job benefit scam never give tuition reimbursement anyone work chevron station never got one heard applied ever gotten even give reason get want give money tuition planning work chevron tuition reimbursement suggest look elsewhere different company tip way get tip accept get trouble management get tip take tell back say something salary still low become management management math read write manager asked spell basic word learned like nd rd grade even write paragraph use calculator basic math may get split day favorite management also get schedule changed le hour favorite management management hire anyone willing work level coworkers may vary people difficult work huge slacker started someone worked hard well chevron station trying actually get work done well end ended caring working others allowed slack plus minimum wage salary reason work well;-0.46;-0.98;0.98;0

Potential to make hundreds of thousands a year if you can climb the ladder enough.;Refinery Experience: The company has the worst business models I’ve come across. Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels. If being a 2 was not just the general population employee.;pro good benefit form pension k match relatively inexpensive medical insurance potential make hundred thousand year climb ladder enough con refinery experience company worst business model come across zero access leading technology common business industry group creates month roadblock try introduce new platform program another month roadblock trying get contract signed keep company information confidential standard allow u keep industry leading program instead group create program take input program group use keep updated everyone refinery talk chevron way nice everyone holding people accountable scraping one anything lot people going flow instead pioneering new model trying improve whole concept pension good pay people want stay around sound like broken business plan one keep track money contractor sending extra work scope paid track anything contract written time material want cmco process know right versus wrong lazy time material easier contractor dream come true finish job submit markup welder failed gouge weld thursday friday pay double time come saturday fix rejected work literally idea manage contractor let slide every year plenty psg team lead second level manager idea manage something seriously need fixed future leader bred lead poor individual future chevron depends internal growth upcoming employee proper leadership training need happen annual review process need tweaking rank stellar one turd issue someone boarder almost someone boarder grouped actual performance far use would make much sense think current system would fine incentive employee perform higher level general population employee;0.67;-0.83;0.85;0

There used to be great qualities about the jobs at this company which have been all lost with bad management and poor decisions.;"- Continuous over-hiring and laying off trend never ended over the three years putting all employees at the edge of their seats and making it a very uncomfortable environment to work at. - Bad ranking system. The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at.";pro schedule allows take every friday work hr day good matching contribution k used great quality job company lost bad management poor decision con continuous hiring laying trend never ended three year putting employee edge seat making uncomfortable environment work bad ranking system ranking system take performance evaluation account give score determine next year salary ranking performance evaluation standard across company even business unit always hand higher management throw bus scapegoat needed reason may accomplish everything put performance agreement beginning year help employee work group manager get recognized especially manager manager worked talk adversely constant comparative environment promotes individualism teamwork continuously race compare similar salary grade coworkers treat like race horse year year good structural organization system place year knowing ups down oil price effect economics moment oil price dip company ready lay employee immediately company care stock price order sacrifice stock price sacrifice employee time make feel worthless valued whatsoever meanwhile seen many process rolled taken year le never fit purpose time waster everyone company tried look good outside overload meeting setup meeting perceived working although actually self sufficient know plan manage time work along coworkers work meeting company waste time time moreover listen safety briefing work always upper management supervisor take credit supervisor request work asked upper management work supervisor present work receives credit seen lead engineer make number save back reporting upper management unethical rest team say anything fear losing job non stop talk chevron way transparency teamwork follow none result con never seen many professional leave chevron including last year especially called reorganization done end kept lower salary grade people completely miserable assignment working situation placed;-0.23;-0.81;0.75;0

Veolia;DO NOT WORK HERE;Benefits, potential high pay and nothing else!;"The work environment is horrible, but especially for women. This is a total good boys club and if you aren't friends with the higher ups, and drink with them then you are not getting promotions and will be put into the worst jobs/situations, and they will punish you for not ""being in the circle"". This company led me on for a year, had me doing work for a position they never intended to give me and kept stringing me along, all while promoting their friends. They don't carry themselves professionally and it's actually sad watching the way they speak to customers, they're a joke to work for and with. I do not recommend this company to anyone, but ESPECIALLY to those who have a degree. They will put you in the lowest position and try to get you to drive trucks. They're an environmental company that doesn't even recycle or have one care for their environmental impact. If you care about using your education or at least having your degree provide you with a better position than what someone with a GED would get then do not even look twice at this place. OH and if you hate nepotism then this company will drive you wild! They hire family and only take care of each other so you'll never have a position that meets your potential because they'd rather give it to someone completely incompetent than to you. If you're a women they speak poorly of you, expect you to do physically tasking work and don't stand up for you when men in the field are sexually harassing you. If they do bring anything to HR, it goes no where and nothing gets resolved.

Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment.

People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management.

I recommend only staying for two years or less at maximum and then look for another job.;Laboratory management loves to micromanage employees. Expect to be criticized if you do things your way. Theres a lot of gossip going around with the senior staff who bad mouth other employees. Very little to no team player effort by senior staff. They will belittle you, and information does not spread evenly through staff. You will hear differences in information within the department. The laboratory needs to work on their Environmental, Health, and Safety culture as well. Some fume hoods did not work, which leads to higher exposure of hazardous chemicals. There is favoritism as well. Little to no upward mobility within the laboratory even after I assumed more responsibility after another employee left. They will overwork you, and still won't offer you more pay. Overall, I would say the lab has a very unprofessional atmosphere and toxic work culture.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro fresh college need experience get foot door recommend job recommend staying two year le maximum look another job con laboratory management love micromanage employee expect criticized thing way there lot gossip going around senior staff bad mouth employee little team player effort senior staff belittle information spread evenly staff hear difference information within department laboratory need work environmental health safety culture well fume hood work lead higher exposure hazardous chemical favoritism well little upward mobility within laboratory even assumed responsibility another employee left overwork still offer pay overall would say lab unprofessional atmosphere toxic work culture person found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.74;-0.83;0.4;0

Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment.

Company is not very transparent about issues, and cover up is another word for discretion. Most employees are blindsided by the company official attitude since the newspaper is a better source of news than the internal communication. Supervisors are known to berate their employees vs training them. Union vs non-union jobs are set against each other, and engineers are told to not even think about unionizing and to listen to their union peers so they can pass their info up to management. Benefits are mediocre, 401k contribution is the lowest I ever seen in any company, vacation time is not used up and it's loss due to managers not approving on time. Not many career opportunities, training outside of the office is discouraged and denied all the time. Conference attendance is not funded except for managers, individual contributors are not allowed to go to training or conferences.;pro nice office facility food truck twice week open air desk small breakrooms con every group silo group know mistake happen due lack communication supervisor spy group tattle tell internet even job requires people good university background however make pretty arrogant manager engineer refuse work contractor believe know best regardless evidence company transparent issue cover another word discretion employee blindsided company official attitude since newspaper better source news internal communication supervisor known berate employee v training union v non union job set engineer told even think unionizing listen union peer pas info management benefit mediocre k contribution lowest ever seen company vacation time used loss due manager approving time many career opportunity training outside office discouraged denied time conference attendance funded except manager individual contributor allowed go training conference;0.42;-0.79;0.49;0

Many volunteer opportunities Lot of job shadowing and mentor ship opportunities as well Many of the employees there were really cool people. Management on the other hand have become a toxic club. They encouraged zero empathy. They are so far from their advertised culture, it's not funny.;If you're not part of the union, you will get the short end of the stick on raises, bonuses, and anything else. They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable. I learned the hard way that if you attempt to file a complaint about another employee, it's not confidential. And for attempting it, the employee (management) will retaliate and make your life miserable.;pro pension k back among best industry many volunteer opportunity lot job shadowing mentor ship opportunity well many employee really cool people management hand become toxic club encouraged zero empathy far advertised culture funny con part union get short end stick raise bonus anything else promote discussion safety culture completely superficial one thing need identify employee yes men exception first supervisor people old team never spoke meeting anymore director time would always reject idea yet openly ask feedback accepting supervisor used good guy became hole got promoted something becoming supervisor pg e turn heartless overseer main message part union expendable supposed union first year proved another department union leader vouched break open hornet nest turned union decided fire cover mistake union contractor helped negotiation would dishonorably fired without severance pay also pg e hr despicable learned hard way attempt file complaint another employee confidential attempting employee management retaliate make life miserable;0.95;-0.91;0.97;0

PGandE;Good pay, bad mgmt, no flexibility to work remote;Pay is above average for cyber security roles. Hour expectaions are low, meaning theres little pressure to complete work quickly (until theres a crisis). I have a lot of autonomy. Even with the bankruptcy, am fairly secure in my position. Little outsourcing to other geographies.;All of my observations apply to IT and Cybersecurity only. Average output and work ethic in these groups is extremely low. Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours. Facilities outside of San Francisco are often very basic or even shoddy. If considering a position outside of SF, make sure to tour the work site.

PGandE;I'm here to stay;PG&E is one of few companies left that offer a pension to employees. On top of the above average benefits one normally sees at a career level job, PG&E offers multiple additional resources and perks such as discounts and complimentary services, too many to mention. Example being a discount on the utility bill (25% off - if it's with PG&E), Major cell carrier bill discounts, travel, loans, commodities etc. PG&E really cares about health and well being and strives to reduce work related injuries (from desk jobs to field work) by offering ergonomic assessments and equipment to reduce fatigue.;Being a big corporation, change moves slowly and bureaucracy is common gossip around the office. When there is change, it's usually across the board which is both disruptive and can put people out of positions even if their performance is exemplary since they are now a gold plated square peg for a round hole. Though upper management (which there is many layers of) does put effort to reposition these employees its can sometime be hard for the peons to get themselves heard with results.;pro pg e one company left offer pension employee top average benefit one normally see career level job pg e offer multiple additional resource perk discount complimentary service many mention example discount utility bill pg e major cell carrier bill discount travel loan commodity etc pg e really care health well strives reduce work related injury desk job field work offering ergonomic assessment equipment reduce fatigue con big corporation change move slowly bureaucracy common gossip around office change usually across board disruptive put people position even performance exemplary since gold plated square peg round hole though upper management many layer put effort reposition employee sometime hard peon get heard result;0.87;-0.53;0.65;0

For the most part people have no problem sharing their knowledge with you, all it takes is a coffee or lunch every now and then. -Easily accessible location from East Bay... Peninsula side not so much.;-Out of touch. Their business will continue to shrink because of all the CCA's and renewables eating into their market share. Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits.;pro people work great one reason stayed long alot smart passionate people alot year experience people new industry great opportunity learn expert part people problem sharing knowledge take coffee lunch every easily accessible location east bay peninsula side much con touch business continue shrink cca renewables eating market share eventually get point manage transmission line even best job innovating field poor job security many staff outsourced started expand business group poor management kind like locker room vibe either fit get stomped try rock boat find way get rid make life miserable try give impression file grievance work place issue openly without persecution kind false evident calibration meeting participated one manager office shocked see essentially manager bashing team member everyone else sitting nodding agreement adding negative comment people getting praised seemed type people sit around talking water cooler instead actual work attractive recent grad weird see manager praise employee day team meeting manager totally crap person holed room management staff calibration alot behind back stuff people aware calibration bread butter promotion process manager praise calibration going tough time manager know impact interaction along future promotion salary increase set tone manager also see result yeah get someone bad side tricky hill climb premier survey traced mindful say truthful want keep job know colleague truthful job dissatisfaction laid despite solid performer growth company shrinking creating new position replacing people left greener pasture got laid unless outsourced worker country ton reorgs expect new manager director every six month ton project follow executive management convoluted business process sometimes feel like certain process look busy serve real world purpose hearing co worker lineman dying field huge bummer even worse see pg e donates zero money help family dying job working pg e hearing san bruno every week tragedy happened like year ago yet every month new fine put place something remind going required ethic course work listening snippet enron tape finding one top guy issuing order tape hired pg e director worked year retiring benefit;0.96;-0.9;0.99;0

BP;Beware of BP;The work is interesting and the coworkers are generally friendly. I was always paid on time.;You should be aware that BP has an official program that involves paying financial incentives to managers when diversity targets are met for women and/or Black employees. If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often.7 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor;pro work interesting coworkers generally friendly always paid time con aware bp official program involves paying financial incentive manager diversity target met woman black employee non black male strongly urge pursue employer joined bp company reputation two thing catastrophic accident layoff current employee think reputation well deserved bp invests heavily outsourcing technology company retains army staff design workflow work process others mean job constantly change constantly designed designed people lack experience role endure consequence decision always risk laid doubt ever feeling job security personal relationship happiness likely suffer believe say want work better career better life elsewhere third final thing aware bp excellent saying never observed single instance bp saying yes something already explicitly approved policy matter situation circumstance based experience answer always reckless enough accept role bp expect hear word often people found review helpfulhelpfulsharerepor;0.71;0.76;0.95;0

Lots of smart and talented people, at least where I worked. Good diversity and inclusion.;Recent layoffs have gutted the company, leaving it understaffed and lacking experience. The transformation to an Agile work environment means staff are deployed on projects and seem to rush to get work done during the sprints. This might lead to the 80% solution becoming the 50% solution. New CEO bernard looney has re-imagined bp by transforming it into a utility company and shrinking oil and gas production 40% by 2030, and even less by 2050. The end result is that if you're a geoscientist and want a career in oil & gas, you should see working at bp as a dead-end and start looking for a new employer. In exploration, every new discovery is another step closer to making your job redundant.

The company is very clique-y and if you're not part of the ones that managers like, even if you do your job well, the managers will make sure to get rid of you and replace you with one of their buddies. It's very dogmatic and behind the times. BP is not a leader in the industry, it's a follower. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they just keep reworking the same problem over and over with the same mindset and never find a solution to anything. Anyone that tries to challenge dogma and come up with new ideas is considered a trouble-maker and someone that rocks the boat. Management doesn't want anyone to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems, even though they say ad nauseam that they do, because God forbid that someone exposes their incompetence. All they want is complacent worker bees that keep their heads down and brown nose managers' insatiable egos. No wonder Exxon and the other majors think of BP as a joke. When this company continues to compare their performance to those of the minors instead of the majors, you know there's something seriously wrong.

BP;For what it is, pretty good. Needs some improvement, but who doesn't?;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks.

There are many programs that the only way you find out about them is by asking your coworkers, and that is what HR expects. Sometimes it seems that the extraneous programs and initiatives are more important to management than being good at your job.

BP;It's surreal;$$$, pension, matching 401k and yearly bonus... only average though compared to local market. Company is great when it comes to family or medical emergencies. No thanks to management, I think HR probably forces managers to behave like decent human beings on most occasions. Company has clearly done a lot to promote women in the workplace over the last few years. Quite entertaining meetings where you'll see and hear what must be some of the most incompetent, try-hard people on the planet spew a lifetime supply of buzzwords and navigate through the endless wilderness of BP corporate processes and re-organization. Much like living in an episode of 'The Office'.;Sickening to see just how much money is wasted. They may as well be lighting piles of money on fire around here. Even with strides made towards promoting women, nepotism and good ol' boy system is alive and well. Hiring and promoting other minorities has clearly fallen short. The only real reason to come to work is the pay. Spineless, boot-lick middle managers report to type-A bullies. Even the simplest decisions get passed up to the second line and VP positions. Pretty sure you need to murder someone before you get fired. Seriously. Incompetent people get passed around group to group (sometimes even promoted) for years. Showing up for work, doing your job and trying to protect the business is often under appreciated. If you really want to go places with this company, be prepared to cultivate personal friendships with managers. Company coddles new engineers, the 'challenge' program is a joke. Process, process, process. BP has a sick obsession with paperwork, checklists, creating do-nothing middle management positions and other non-revenue earning paper pushers.

This is probably the one thing that makes me proud to work here.";"Company lacks minorities and women in leadership and will go out of their way not to promote minorities from within. I wouldn't recommend anyone who looks like me to come here. While the package to get you in the door may look impressive and promising; your opportunities for advancement are not. On average, a person of color remains in the same job they hired into the company 5 to 10 years later while white counter parts experience 1-2 promotions within that same time span. This company will promote a white person without proper qualifications in a heartbeat, but will pick apart the qualifications of a person of color and find reasons not to promote them. It's truly sad that you can ask any random employee of color (especially black employees) about their career experience and they all have similar stories. In some departments this place is run like a modern day plantation. Dont waste your time complaining about it. The HR, Ethics and Legal departments turn a side eye to everything and you will definitely be retaliated against for speaking up about an issue.Advice to ManagementI'm not sure what to think about the Diversity and Inclusion initiatives the company has now adapted. Right now there is a lot of work going on to promote an inclusive culture. While I am appreciative of these steps- the company has a long way to go. In my opinion the company is still doing a lot of talking the talk but not walking the walk in terms of promotions. The company does a great job hiring minorities but not promoting them.

DTE;Customer Care Representative;Continuous Improvements intentions, Cafeteria, pay on time, good community oriented corporate citizen, nice people work at headquarters, customer service focus.;Old fashioned company, the majority of employees have been there for a long time, so they don't know things can be better (benefit package is mediocre), no discount on their services to employees, different departments don't communicate well with each other, low starting pay, my experience left me feeling the company is more interested in their community image and reputation rather than making employees feel valued. I don't feel safe working there. There are many visitors, construction contractors and contracted employees there all the time. I couldn't look at a person and immediately tell they were an employee. Parking isn't very secure. There is a great security presence once inside, but it seemed like I worked in a public place (equivalent to an airport). Too many different unions usually mean problem with management and employee relations. Computer system (CSB) should be retired now!Advice to ManagementValue your employees and your employees will value your customers. Empower frontline employees more. When hiring it would be more beneficial to take advantage of new employee's skills vs. being so rigid with the job description. The opposite occurs when there are unions involved, unfortunately. Considering giving CRs the option of working from home. It would make a better work life balance, especially since there is the use of mandatory overtime. Good luck with the new customer system, because the current one is not very user friendly/efficient.

We have lots of employees and that gives us leverage during negotiations with insurance companies, but I'm not sure it's idea effectively.;Although the folks are lovely, having HQ in Findlay is not sustainable for the long term future of the company.Unless you're an executive, you're flying in and out of Detroit, which is a huge chore and time waster.We might see some co-location progress now that the new CDO will be based out of SA.Also, a big hangup is that IT is constantly prevented from speaking directly to business users when we need answers.

Marathon;Great company, but at risk of getting left behind;It is a company with great people, great pay, and great benefits. There are many opportunities from coast to coast, so you could spend your entire career at one company. Despite the stigma that often comes with an O&G company, MPC is truly trying to lead the industry in its environmental sustainability efforts, while remaining pragmatic and realistic about the world's demand for affordable and reliable energy. Not withstanding the corporate office in Findlay, MPC offers a great deal of work locations across the country that could fit anyone's desired geographic preference and allows those that desire it, to experience different cultures, climates, and cuisines.;"The CEO is old fashioned and out of touch. Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things. This was apparent during the integration of Andeavor. I know it surprised everyone, especially those in Findlay, how many people at all levels of the organization chose voluntary separation rather than move to Findlay, or to continue on in an organization where you are automatically viewed as a inferior outsider. In order to advance within MPC, you must come to the realization that eventually, ""All roads lead to Findlay"". Despite being in a great position with a lot of future opportunity for growth, when that decision day comes for me, my road won't be going to Findlay.Advice to ManagementMove the HQ out of Findlay and step into the 21st century with regards to work practices and work/life balance.
