4849,447,"1. If you have over 3 years experience and are looking to advance your career, GE may not be the place. GE has a few advancement programs and if you aren't in one of the programs, your career growth will be slow. In finance, most of the management comes out of the advancement programs and when people leave one of the advancement programs, they have a better chance of getting a Lead, Management, or Sr. Management role. So either come to GE with 0-3 years of experience and join an advancement program, or come to GE as a manager or above. 2. GE will not pay for any certification (i.e. PMP and CPA), and they have cut back on approving MBA classes. But this may change once the cashflow improves. 3. Your success at GE is too dependent on your manager. If you have a bad manager or a manager who doesn't care about your growth, find a role with a better manager or leave GE..

Workload /responsibilities/documentation exponentially increased in the past 5 years, especially if your a plant engineer. The amount of documentation, double checking, overlapping initiatives/systems eat your time and resources from more pressing matters. 3. No accountability or initiative, if your the engineer your going to have to tell your maintenance/planners every dot iota before they do anything. What I mean is your going to have to do part of their work before anything really gets going. If you don’t do this constant following up and handholding, after you’ve done your part, you will be blamed for the item not getting finished. 4. Forced ranking system is applied during evaluation, opaque expectations from management. Whatever management told you at the beginning of the year doesn’t mean they don’t have their separate criteria that your unaware of. Unless your an absolute star 💫 of an engineer , what will matter is how often you did presentations in front of management. If you handle ABCD and they want to say no they’ll cite an EFGH and that literally could be anything, could be as minor as not riding the company bus enough. De-prioritizing doing the job and prioritising presentations will land you better evaluations. This is very difficult when your a plant engineer handling daily activities and concerns. Management kinda assumes your doing the basic duties anyways, so rewards presentations and such activities, but will not if your the one or one of two guys handling whole systems of the plant. +privilege, if you have the right last family names, you’ll just so happen to ‘get along’ better with upper management. I do not want to say that it’s a sole determining driver in evaluations, it’s not. It’s more like this is the equivalent of ‘white privilege’ in America. Things will just so happen to go easier for you and more opportunities will open up as well. 5. When everything is a priority 1, nothing really is.

Due to the way he handled acquisition of Andeavor (making promises and not keeping them), he lost a great deal of trust from the new employee base. I don't believe that can ever be regained. . . The company needs to propel itself into the 21st century and realize that cramming more people into smaller and smaller spaces does not increase efficiency. Especially in this age of technology, MPC needs to consider adopting more modern work practices, including flexible work schedules and telecommuting. Its competitors (from a talent acquisition perspective) are offering far more attractive work environments and life/work balance. . . They are truly trying to make strides in advancing diversity of the workforce. However, they will never achieve this until someone makes the bold step (hopefully the new CEO) of moving the corporate headquarters out of Findlay, OH. This refers not only to achieving racial and ethnic diversity, but also achieving diversity of thought and experience, especially at the leadership levels. The country is much bigger than just the rural Midwest. . . Because of its small town Ohio location, most people working at MPC (especially in the Midwest) have only ever worked for MPC (sometimes several generations). This creates a singular way of thinking that tends to shut out (or shutdown) alternative viewpoints and perspectives. MPC is very resistant to hiring outside talent (mid-career), especially at any type of leadership positions (to be fair, there have a been a few high level exceptions). I believe this also creates a skewed sense of reality. Their is an ingrained sense of self greatness, which clouds their ability to consider different ways of doing things.

Maintenance department managers show favoritism to employees that truly do not deserve the promotions that were received. I was told for myself when Marathon repurchased the st Paul park refinery by the HR professionals from corporate that I would qualify for the retirement health benefits at the time they purchased the refinery. 2 years later I was laid off due to covid and corporate restructuring. the severance package was good but not I hit the lottery. but 3 weeks before I was supposed to start my retirement health plan I receive a letter stating what I needed to do to enroll in the program. the next week I receive another letter saying that I do not qualify for the retirement health care program????? i called HR and was basically told to bad. I called and tried to explain what I was told at the transition and that I had 25+ years with the company.

If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often..

7611,379,"-Out of touch. Their business will continue to shrink because of all the CCA's and renewables eating into their market share. Eventually it will get to the point where all they'll do is manage transmission lines but even then they're not doing the best job or innovating in that field. -Poor job security. Many of the staff are being outsourced, they've started with IT but will expand to other business groups. -Poor management. It's kind of like a locker room vibe, you either fit in or get stomped out. If you try to rock the boat they'll find a way to get rid of you or make your life miserable. -They try to give off the impression that you can file grievances about work place issues openly without persecution but that's kind of false which is evident in the calibration meetings. I participated in one when my manager was out of the office and was shocked to see that it's essentially each manager bashing his/her own team members and everyone else just sitting there nodding in agreement or adding their own negative comments. The only people getting praised seemed to be the type of people that sit around talking at the water cooler instead of doing actual work or attractive recent grads. It was weird to see managers praise an employee days before at a team meeting, only for the same manager to totally crap on that person when holed up in a room with other management staff at the calibration. There's alot of behind the back stuff that people should be aware of. -The calibration is the bread and butter of the promotion process, if your manager doesn't praise you at the calibration you're going to have a tough time there because all of the managers know and it impacts their interactions with you along with future promotions and salary increases. It sets the tone. Other managers can also see the results, so yeah if you get on someone's bad side it can be a tricky hill to climb. -The Premier Survey's can be traced so be mindful of what you say in them, don't be 100% truthful if you want to keep your job. I know a few of my colleagues who were truthful about their job dissatisfaction and were laid off despite being solid performers. -No growth, the company is shrinking. They aren't creating new positions and nor are they replacing people who left for greener pastures or got laid off, unless you're an outsourced worker from other country. -Tons of reorgs, expect to have a new manager/director every six months. -Tons of projects but no follow through from executive or management. -Convoluted business processes, sometimes I feel like they have certain processes just to look busy but serve no real world purpose. -Hearing about co-workers (lineman) dying on the field is a huge bummer. It's even worse when you see that PG&E donates zero money to help their families when they're dying on the job working for PG&E. -Hearing about San Bruno every other week, the tragedy happened like 10+ years ago yet every few months there's a new fine put in place or something to remind you about it. -Going into the required Ethics course at work and listening to snippets from the Enron tapes, then finding out that one of the top guys issuing orders on the tapes was hired by PG&E as a director and worked there for years before retiring with benefits..

Incidents and work requests often go unassigned for weeks or more and its difficult to keep people accountable for things. Escalating to managers is rare and when done, managers generally dont respond. Ive had to escalate and contact three levels up to get simple tasks done. Managers dont actively manage their reports unless theres a crisis. They want people in seats as there is little understanding of the work and how to manage by goals. The bureaucracy is maddening and managers are usually contributing to that rather than reducing it. They blindly follow rules and process such as beginning every meeting repeating the same safety rules. Im so tired of reviewing active-shooter safety rules multiple times per day. We emphasize safety only so we can say we emphasize safety. I dont think anyone is asking whether its actually effective. Management not understanding goal oriented management together with an HR incident in 2018 (where managers authorizing overtime for employees who werent working or on site) led to elimination of any remote work flexibility. A total overreaction. We used to be able to work remotely either for a day or a few hours to balance family needs. But at the beginning of 2019, Cyber changed its policy so all remote work requests require executive approval. There are some managers who will look the other way for a couple-few hours but most still require approval. My manager insists on it for even working remote a couple of hours.

They promote *discussions* of safety culture, but it's completely superficial. It's just one more thing they need to identify employees who are not yes-men. With the exception of my first supervisor, people in my old team never spoke up in meetings anymore. Because the director at the time would always reject their ideas, yet openly ask for feedback as if he was accepting. And the supervisor who used to be a good guy became an a-hole when he got promoted. Something about becoming a supervisor at PG&E just turns you into heartless overseers. My main message is this: if you're not part of the union, you are expendable. I was supposed to have been in the union for the first 3 to 4 years. But it was not until I proved myself with another department that a union leader vouched for me only to break open a hornet's nest. It turned out I should've been in the union, but decided to fire me to cover up that mistake. If it wasn't a union contractor who helped with negotiations, I would've been dishonorably fired without severance pay. Also PG&E's HR is just as despicable.

While you may think that I am bitter at CoP for for the loss of my employment, I would have given this same review while employed if I had known about these glassdoor reviews. There is WAY to much focus on playing the game rather than running a business. Employees and more specifically managers are too involved in furthering their career than making good business decisions. From my experience, managers spend more effort building their fiefdom, climbing upward of around than ""managing"" their teams, or actually being a leader. The CEO Ryan Lance and other exec's want the company to be a nimble aggressive quick mover. Unfortunately, the system is clogged with managers who are trained in the big company political system, or are bottle necked by another layer of management who just doesn't understand how this new quick to learn and change fast paced industry. I know it is a big company and we all hear that every big company is this bureaucratic and this way. But who is saying this? Have they ever actually worked at another company. It is an excuse not to try to become better. The company has lots of potential that is is failing to achieve. I know it will never be perfect and isn't as good as it could be. Many employees are not actually good at what they are employed to do. It surprised in every group I was in how many people didn't actually know how to do their job. These employees have been around for years and never been fired. It is astounding. And the employees of which I noticed who were good at their job were continuously frustrated. Frustrated by working with these incompetent co-workers or in a system of incompetence. Strangely enough, these skilled workers got frustrated and quit, gave up, or were even laid off. All while the lesser skilled employees remained. Many cases it was because it was more beneficial for the said employee to ""play the game"" politically rather than develop their technical skills. This ConocoPhillips culture creates a workforce that rewards the self promoting, deceptive and unskilled, rather than a collaborative, honest, and skilled workforce. I know I would still be employed if I had focused not on making better business and technical personal technical improvements, but rather to have spent more time kissing up to my managers, with constant private conversations, taking managers out for lunch and drinks with them, and playing the political game.

1222,472,"The prior CEO was less than competent when it came to succession management and leadership development; his constant firing and churning of the upstream leadership and risk aversion led to sub-optimized investment performance. As a result of the $34B writedown of 2009, he was named the worst CEO of the first decade of this century by Business Week magazine. Rightly so. He paid too much for assets (he preferred to by oil & gas reserves since he couldn't find any), ran off talented middle & senior level management, dis-incentivized the organic development of new assets (hasn't found any new oil in 16 years), developed no deepwater capabilities, alienated petroleum engineers and geologists, kept investment strategy secret (even to his own staff), sold off valuable assets, kept lousy assets despite good offers and split the integrated company right before the inevitable cyclical downturn of the oil & gas industry. This has left a husk of an upstream company which is incapable of operating like a smaller independent oil company, is struggling to retain what little talent is left and is scraping for investment cash flows (cut the dividend last month)..

The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows.

Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same.

81,81,"- The worst management (including supervisors) gets promoted & many are micromanagers - Upper management has selective hearing when it comes to feedback - Some sites (Beaumont and Baton Rouge) are worse than living in Chernobyl - All the diverse and friendly people leave within the first couple of years - Executives like pocketing more money for themselves while lower level employees face minimal salary raises (if we get salary raises) - Lack of transparency across the board (i.e. we learn of salary freezes, 401k cuts, layoffs, etc. through news outlets) - The younger generation knows this industry is not sustainable and views Exxon as the most evil compared to its peers - Communications on serious issues (i.e. COVID, BLM, Anti-Asian rhetoric) are purely reactive and are put out there as a response to employee dissatisfaction - Working from home for non-essential roles was not an option, even as peers contracted COVID-19. The company's scapegoat was ""they likely were exposed during their lunch break"" since the exposure could not be ""proven"" to occur during the 12-person meeting in the conference room (note this was before vaccines were rolled out). - Everything is an ""emergency"" in the eyes of management and they will drain your energy preparing for minute issues - Overall lack of diversity that will continue to propagate discriminatory behavior and microaggressions throughout the company - ""This is the way we've always done it, so we will continue doing everything this way"" will get you rewarded rather than challenging the status quo - The CEO and other executives only care about shareholders, never the individual contributors - Town Halls will actively censor messages and questions - ""Management's hands are tied"" is the excuse that is communicated for everything - Roles will continue to be outsourced abroad to save costs, despite the additional complications with timely communications - Management will not admit that they a culture revamp to retain talent - Talent is escaping to industries that better value their employees (i.e. Tech & Consulting), but Exxon will not enhance their benefits package accordingly - Only Chemical Engineering degrees are truly valued in the company. This is a not-so-secret expectation on how to quickly accelerate your career here. - Sustainability initiatives are minimal - In order to be successful, you are required to follow a traditional career path through manufacturing roles - If you do something bad, supervisors will not support you. If you do something good, supervisors will take credit for the work you did. - The expectation is that you need to respond within 24 hours if someone needs you while on vacation - The cultural issues stem throughout the entire company! Not only within one function (i.e. chemicals vs. upstream or supply chain vs. technical) - A supervisor once told me ""the people who do well here take ownership,"" which is ironic considering that the company as a whole has not been taking ownership over its poor culture that has caused top talent to apply elsewhere..

The amount of rework on small things is outrageous meanwhile critical tasks aren't getting completed due to poor work prioritization from the supervisor. New performance assessments are more of a popularity and personality contest as supervisors fail to understand and give proper credit for real work by employees. People will tell outright lies to try and get their way or put others down. Employee concerns are not properly addressed as the organization only cares about what's coming from the top-down. The individuals who do care aren't are in a position to bring change. Work life balance and flex policies are a joke for most jobs. My coworkers are stressed, frustrated, and running out of patience. Despite all this, management continues to paint things as a pretty picture and will repeatedly talk about culture and ""one team"" and how we should be so excited to be a part of this work. There are way too many managers and too many p***ing contests that results in lack of clarity and constant change in direction for individual contributors.

179,179,And I will quote a senior manager during a ranking session a few years ago “why is everyone so fussed about this process. It’s just about salary administration”. Flash forward a couple of years and I guess what he meant is administration of no salary upon layoffs of highly capable people. The desire to cling to an early 1900s management philosophy of fear and punishment is driven by those who benefited from this system. The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry. There is a serious lack of vision and an attitude of “don’t worry it will all be fine” as it is clear the ship is sinking! I implore anyone considering hiring on to at least look at the stock price over the last 5 years. After recovering from COVID lows the downward trend is right where it has been for that period.
