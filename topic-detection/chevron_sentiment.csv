"bureaucratic mess, good benefits","{ Pros. Decent salary and good benefits. People are generally nice. Can be really cushy if you're OK just doing the minimum to get a good review/bonus. I think the happiest people are the ones who find a sweet spot and ride things out for a long period (long-term benefits are great). } { Cons. We're in a slowly dying industry and lack a clear direction forward. This is reflected in our inability to attract and retain talent from top universities. Think to yourself, why would an engineer from Stanford go to Chevron instead of a tech firm? Internally, we have an exhausting bureaucracy that is highly political and difficult to navigate. At the heart, this is an engineering company, and it is presumed that engineers can do anything. In an era of changing dynamics and enormous pressure from investors and policymakers to move away from fossil fuels, the old school engineer mentality could end up being our downfall. If you're not an engineer (i.e., you're a market analyst, economist, climate person) I'd recommend staying away--you're career path will likely be limited here, and you'll be frustrated by the slow pace, extra work to deal with enormous overhead, and lack of clarity on our goals.1 person found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor }",0.98

There is no employee break room, so you'll have to hang out in the soapy Joe's break room, There is no room for promotion, even one of the other cashier's that has been here for 4 years makes the same amount as someone working there for 1 year, due to the owner wanting to save more money in his pocket. Even everything in the store went up by .30 cents and the gas a few months ago was $4.19 to $4.79.

This lead to the adoption of a hybrid conglomerate of multiple operating models. As an external hire who has spent a number of years here, I can say this place is as good as your manager and perhaps worse since the opportunities to switch roles seems to have dried up with the org changes.3 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor }",0.43

An average DSM makes roughly 120k-150k. Other companies are 200k+. The benefits are now horrible to keep up dividends for shareholders. Old timers said the company was lower paying but had job security compared to other O&G jobs, not anymore. Layoffs every 3-4 years for field staff. The field will have promotion freezes and layoffs but all the office staff sits safely in their positions or even promotions amid field layoffs.

"Great intentions, trips over itself seometimes","{ Pros. Managers and leadership at Chevron care about their employees and spend the time and money to show it. It's almost painful sometimes and several lifelong Chevron employees don't realize how great they have it. You're also working with a large number of capable people who want to do good work. In my experience, if those that are only a few months away from retirement still put in significant effort. They want the company and the people there to succeed. } { Cons. I don't think this is unique to Chevron, more a consequence of being a large company with long-tenured employees - in many groups voicing disagreement or new ideas has to be done very skillfully or you can come off as 'a jerk' even if it would be considered fairly polite at other companies.

Like many corporations, Chevron is bending the knee to the ""Social Justice"" movement. This means that the workforce is being atomized and pitted against itself. Reference Chevron's press releases from earlier this year crowing about how personnel reductions at upper levels had disproportionately affected white men. This trend can be linked to some large investors very loudly proclaiming a focus on so-called ""ES&G"" metrics. This also brings about an irrational focus on ""going green"". Up until a year or so ago, I was proud to see Chevron was resisting the industry trend of mouthing the ""Carbon is bad"" mantra. This has flipped and quickly in the last year.

Not the Company it Once Was,"{ Pros. In general the benefits are pretty good. The company focuses on safety. A fairly good work life balance, but constant downsizings have eroded some of this. The company has many employee networks to improve employee experience. The company is trying to take care of the thousands of employees being laid off. } { Cons. I hate to say it, but avoid this company like the plague. I used to love working for Chevron, but now I’m just trying to hang on until retirement. Constant downsizing has destroyed the previous collaborative culture. It is now a dog eat dog company. Politics rule all decisions. Personnel decisions are based on favoritism and cliques. If you do not have a powerful sponsor, prepare for a lousy job or a target on your back for the next downsizing. The focus is on cost cutting and improving the bottom line. This is a declining industry and management has not made any meaningful changes to embrace a lower-carbon future. If you are in any service function your job will be automated or outsourced to Philippines or Argentina. If you are a petrotech, it’s still not too bad, but if you have a long career left, get out of O&G. Retrain yourself. We are coming through a massive downsizing and will probably have another in less than two years.2 people found this review helpfulHelpfulShareRepor }",0.92

Definitely a good place to start a career...,"{ Pros. For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas. } { Cons. Weak opportunities for non-engineers. If you aren't an engineer, expect to spend your career mostly in the same place and at best climbing the ladder only one or two rungs. Repeated relocations are expected for anyone who wants to climb the ladder. If you are married to someone gainfully employed outside Chevron or are otherwise not positioned to relocate every few years, you'll go nowhere in the long-run. The saying is: ""If you don't move, you don't matter"". Once you reach mid-career, the opportunities become very limited. Training and development is not really intended to help you. If you haven't been flagged as ""high potential"" (rare!) then you'll probably stagnate in your current position or within a narrow set of positions. There is no means for asking for a raise. You'll get 3% to 6% in terms of an annual pay increase, most of which is determined by corporate performance rather than your own. This often makes it worthwhile for employees with more than 5 years experience to go elsewhere if the pay increase is substantial or if they're confident in their talents. Under CEO Mike Wirth, Chevron has gone all-in on ""woke"" politics, in an especially ham-fisted way. If you aren't inclined towards PC culture, you'll need to learn to fake it or at least stay very silent. Race and gender are increasingly major factors in hiring and promotion, which may or may not benefit you. }",0.99

And favoritism all over the place. Mgmt will have drinks on the weekends with their pet employees.

The company holds very high standards so they are picky about how everything is done and how well, (like cleanliness and exactly what to say to customers). Little things like this are cons but not terrible. }",0.77
Hard to impossible to move up,"{ Pros. I've enjoyed working here and am thankful that Chevron has paid for much of my training and education. Benefits are good and they have done a good job with progressive programs like M.A.R.C that has allowed for employees at all levels to have open, candid and supposedly ""safe"" conversations around bias thinking, non-inclusionary practices, and other adverse type of topics that have historically been swept under the carpet. It's a program that ideally will help with molding a better culture that will eliminate the ""good 'ol boy"" mentality in Oil & Gas industry. } { Cons. Current internal hiring process/career development programs are not as inclusionary as it could be, specifically within the IT world. Too many ""badly behaving"" managers are being promoted and allowed to continue to bully or mistreat their direct reports. If you're an admin and have a brain and want to get promoted, stay away from the IT groups here. }",0.98

Chevron was good,"{ Pros. Great people, work was sometimes interesting and fulfilling. I was able to have a long-term career with one (merged several times) company in a time when most people I knew kept a job for less than 3 years. } { Cons. Many parts of the company restructure every 18 or so months, so it was always uncertain if you would have a job or what that job might entail. Very long and demanding work days, and some truly terrible bosses were allowed to change things in a whim. Since the bosses were new to their job every 18 months, no consistency of direction, just consistent values and rigorous business and safety practices. }",0.66

Limited Career Growth and My Way or the Highway Supervisors,"{ Pros. Excellent moving package if you are willing to completely uproot your home life, kids and spouse to move for more money. Good base salaries if you are willing to forget all ethics and be a ""my way or the highway"" supervisor or employee. } { Cons. The company advertises multiple career opportunities but then management or supervisors limit career growth for their departments and direct reports. Chevron brands themselves as a diverse and equal opportunity employer, yet supervisors do not preach what they say and will limit their employees in order to keep good people in their team instead of letting them excel in other job opportunities within the company. Many supervisors have a control issue. If you say one thing, they will make you do the opposite just so they can be right. I have heard from peers that the HR hotline number is useless, only creates more trouble and should never be used even though the company promotes the hotline. Inflexible work schedule. The company promotes work life balance yet the decisions rest in your supervisor's personnel interpretation of work life balance. No room for working remotely and your vacation plans are expected to be changed per the supervisor's request for internal fictitious corporate deadlines. }",0.97
Plain and simple,"{ Pros. The pay and benefits were very competitive. } { Cons. Extremely limited opportunities for career advancement and longevity for African Americans, anyone over the age of 35 and creative strategists with consistently strong /proven results.

Advancement is only targeted for a select few, most with spotty performance and usually from other countries where drilling is active. }",0.91

Most managers don't have experience in the role they are managing. Which is great in theory when it comes to career opportunities. But causes confusion for the middle men.

It's the senior- and mid-level managers in Communications who are clinging to the old boys network, tapping the same (mostly white men) for plumb assignments and passing over better qualified candidates for the favored few. You lose your value the minute you walk in the door and they put you under some manager promoted to a role he has no business running. Once inside, promotions for those outside the inner circle are few and far between. Ranking in communications is based on personality and politics instead of hard work and real enterprise value. Employee surveys are massaged to keep the functional leads in control. }",0.9

Without a doubt I highly recommend,"{ Pros. I recommend this job to anyone. If anyone is thinking of applying to this job go for it but make sure it's for a corporate station. I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back) } { Cons.

Operation Management,"{ Pros. Work lift balance, truly care about their employees well being } { Cons. All the facility closures, the salary structure.

Engaging work, interesting industry, and even without drinking the kool-aid you can recognize the impact of your work on the economy and environment. High commitment to environmental safety and goals around clean energy (despite what some media may claim). Compensation and benefits are great, which is why they keep people for so long. Lots of opportunity to rotate and learn new skills if you're proactive and network effectively. 8% 401(k) match if you contribute 2%. Pension too, which is generally unheard of for non-gov't jobs. } { Cons. Finance teams are slowly getting caught up with technology and advanced analytics, but a lot is lip-service and patting each other on the back for using the right buzzwords. The ranking and pay determination process is archaic, and 1-2 incompetent group or line-level leaders can derail a successful employee.

Exceptionally Good Company,"{ Pros. The benefits package at Chevron is literally unmatched in any other company or industry that I have seen. I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance. } { Cons. It's a very large organization which means it's somewhat bureaucratic. It actually operates as a cooperation which is mostly a negative because it is actually many independent companies working under a leadership organizations (leadership directive?) which means there are many misses in streamlining and drastically increases silos within the organization. Because of longevity of the people that work for the company (a good thing) there is a lot of mindset on outdated logic, process, and procedures, although Chevron recognized this and has been making conscience effort to migrate this and adjust this mindset. There are a lot of restructures and reorganizations within the company as the market for oil constantly shifts and adjusts. }",0.79

Middle-management really struggles in the following areas at this location, mentoring, succession planning, maintaining morale, talent retention. There are clear favorites who get promoted fast, creating an ""us vs. them"" feeling. Many of the supervisors lack basic leadership skills and do not help to make their direct reports feel valued. Most of the people that have less than 10 years experience aren't getting paid enough to buy a house in the Bay Area.

They still use personnel development committees to pay and rank people, which can lead to great inefficiencies (days upon days spent going over ratings and it leads to a highly political environment while also making employees feel undervalued). It's also so slow that employees don't get rankings and pay increases until many months after the fact. Advice - quickly adopt a more nimble and innovative talent management system. The PMP process is too out-dated and younger employees will not have the patience for this kind of system. - Decision-making can be painfully slow with snaking, meetings before meetings, and circling back with stakeholders to a seemingly endless degree. Make a decision and go execute--fail fast if need be. There is such an aversion to risk that it can become mind numbing at times. Again, the younger workforce will not stick around and they are used to and expect a far faster pace. - There is a committee looking at how to to become faster and more nimble...that alone is telling. There are committees for literally everything that circle around with little impact and many people on these committees feel they need to critique things for the sake of saying they made a contribution to the committee. }",0.98

Chevron is a very process oriented company and as such it has trouble making decisions with out a lot of review. Even if the decision is a low risk/low consequence managers will agonize over the decision for months. The older days at Chevron management could make the decision on the day you asked if not in the same discussion. As employee you need to be a suckup and make no critical comments. Management at Chevron does not like to be told that their ideas are sometimes not well thought out and maybe they should talk to their experts },-0.81

"Chevron Stations is one of the worst places to work. Get experience when working here, then leave to get a better job.","{ Pros. First off, Chevron Stations and other departments of Chevron should be separated because they are not the same. Chevron Stations is overloaded with low salary people who slack off during work, and who don't care about their jobs. - Can slack off and do nothing while getting paid, because the managers themselves slack off themselves and let others to do so as well. - Can break practically any rule of Chevron that you want because the managers don't care if you do so or not because they don't care for the company. - Free fountain drinks. } { Cons. - Management and Chevron corporate allow harassment to other employees and nothing will happen to them if you report them. - Management is ruled by people with GEDS, or by the ones that barely passed high school. Thus, management at Chevron have low intelligence. - Management don't care about their job. - Salary is low from start to finish. You start making at exactly minimum wage, and increase by .25 cents every year, and capping to at most 1 or 2 dollars more than the minimum wage. - If you are a hard coworker management and corporate will just make you do all of the work there while the others are allowed to slack off. So basically, you work while the others get paid the same to do nothing. So, in the end why work well at all? - In Oregon you have to pump gas. If you can pump gas well and fast, you be made to pump gas forever. Its harder work than working inside the store. Practically no one likes pumping gas, so you will have like 6 people working and 5 people inside the store talking to each other while you have to pump gas alone outside handling all of the gas pumps. - Management are huge slackers. I had one who just stayed inside the office and was on their cell phone all day. - Management will talk to you and get angry at you if you get a customer complaint, but will completely ignore customer complaints about themselves. - Corporate doesn't care about you, even if they say they do. Your just a pile of replaceable trash to them. They will easily replace you with some guy who's desperate for a job if you don't like your job. - Benefits are a scam. They never give tuition reimbursement to anyone who works at Chevron Stations. I never got it, and no one that I've heard that applied to it has ever gotten it. They don't even give a reason as to why you didn't get it. They just don't want to give you money for tuition. So if your planning to work at Chevron for the tuition reimbursement, I suggest you look elsewhere at a different company. - No tips by the way. If you get a tip and accept it you will get in trouble. But if management gets a tip they will take it and tell you to back off if you say something. - Your salary is still low if you become management. - Management can't do math, can't read, and can't write. I had a manager who asked me how to spell out a basic word that is learned in like 2nd or 3rd grade. They couldn't even write a paragraph, and had to use a calculator for basic math. - You may get split days off if your not a favorite of management, and you will also get your schedule changed in less than 24 hours if your not a favorite of management. - Management hires anyone who is willing to work. So the level of your coworkers may vary from people who are difficult to work with, and with huge slackers. I started off as someone who worked hard and well at Chevron Stations trying to actually get work done and well. In the end I ended up no caring because I was working while the others were allowed to slack off. Plus, I had a minimum wage salary. So, there's no reason to work well. }",-0.99

PSG-21,"{ Pros. Good benefits in the form of pension, 4 to 1 401K match, relatively inexpensive medical insurance. Potential to make hundreds of thousands a year if you can climb the ladder enough. } { Cons. Refinery Experience: The company has the worst business models I’ve come across. Zero access to leading technology that is just common business from other industries. The IT group creates a 6 month roadblock when you try and introduce a new platform or program. Then another 6 month roadblock trying to get a contract signed to keep company information confidential. Our own standards don’t allow us to keep up with any industry leading programs. Instead we have our IT group create programs, which don’t take the input to a program from the groups that will use it. Then they don’t keep it updated. Everyone at the refineries talks about how the “Chevron Way” is being nice to everyone and not holding people accountable and just scraping by, but no one does anything about it. A lot of people just going with the flow instead of pioneering new models and trying to improve the whole concept. Is that because we have a pension and good pay so people just want to stay around? Sounds like a broken business plan. No one keeps track of any money. We have contractors sending in extra work that wasn’t in scope and they’re being paid for it. Because we don’t track anything. Contracts are written on time and material because we don’t want to do the CMCO process. Because we don’t know what is right versus wrong. We’re lazy so time and material is easier. A contractors dream come true. They finish jobs and submit them with 20% markup on both. A welder failed and had to gouge his welds out on Thursday and Friday? We’ll pay him double time to come in Saturday to fix his rejected work. We literally have no idea how to manage contractors and we let slide by every year. There are plenty of PSG-22/23s that are Team Leads and second level managers that have no idea how to manage. This is something that seriously needs fixed. How can the future leaders be bred when they’re lead by poor individuals? The future of Chevron depends on the internal growth of upcoming employees. Proper leadership trainings needs to happen to the 22/23s. The annual review process needs tweaking. The ranks are 3, 2- , 2 , 2+ and 1. 1s being the stellar ones and 3 being the turds. The issue is someone who is on the boarder almost a 2- and someone on the boarder of 2+ are both grouped as 2s. While in actual performance they are far from each other. Why do we not use 1-10? Would make so much more sense. I think the current system would be fine if there was more incentive to have employees perform at higher levels. If being a 2 was not just the general population employee. }",-0.77

Used to be a great company who cared for its employees,"{ Pros. 9/80 schedule which allows you to take off every other Friday when you work 9 hr days. Good matching contribution to 401k. There used to be great qualities about the jobs at this company which have been all lost with bad management and poor decisions. } { Cons. - Continuous over-hiring and laying off trend never ended over the three years putting all employees at the edge of their seats and making it a very uncomfortable environment to work at. - Bad ranking system. The ranking system takes your performance evaluation into account and gives you a score to determine your next year's salary. This ranking and performance evaluation is not standard across the company or even the business unit. You are always in the hands of your higher management and they will throw you under the bus when a scapegoat is needed for any reason. You may accomplish everything they put into your performance agreement in the beginning of the year and more; help other employees, work groups, managers, but it doesn't get recognized especially if your manager or some other managers you worked with talk adversely of you. - Constant comparative environment which promotes individualism, but not teamwork. They continuously race and compare you to the similar salary grade coworkers. They treat you like a race horse year after year. - No good structural organization system has been in place for years knowing the ups and downs of the oil price effects on economics. The moment oil prices dip, this company is ready to lay off their employees immediately. - All the company cares for is their stock prices. In order not to sacrifice stock prices, they will sacrifice employees at any time. Makes you feel very worthless and not valued whatsoever. Meanwhile, I've seen so many processes rolled out and have been taken out in a few years or less because they never were fit for purpose. They were just time-wasters for everyone while the company tried to look good outside. - There is an overload of meetings. If you do not setup meetings, you are not perceived as working although you are actually self-sufficient and know how to plan, manage your time, work along with your coworkers' work. The meetings in this company is a waste of time 99% of the time. Moreover, you have to listen to the same safety briefings over and over and over. - When you do your work, it is always for the upper management. Your supervisor takes the credit. Your supervisor requests the work that is asked from the upper management. You do all the work and the supervisor presents the work and receives the credit. - I've seen lead engineers make up numbers to save their backs in reporting to the upper management. This is 100% unethical, but the rest of the team won't say anything in fear of losing their jobs. - They non-stop talk about Chevron ways, transparency, teamwork. They don't follow none of which. - As a result of all of these cons, I've never seen so many professionals leave Chevron on their own including myself for the last 3 years. Especially after the so-called reorganization that was done at the end of 2017, they kept lower salary grade people whom had been completely miserable at the assignments and working situations they were placed at. }",-0.83

Operations Petrophysicist,{ Pros. Great benefits and opportunity to learn from subject matter experts. } { Cons. There was a turn about for some projects I was working on and some of my areas of subject matter expertise where diminished and not given full value as previously detailed. Some major health and personal issues where overlooked as I worked through them without taking medical leave as was suggested or came back early from medical leave.

Poor choice for experienced / high potential HR candidates,"{ Pros. Very high pay relative to expectations, work/life balance, golden handcuff pension, employees expected to act professional. } { Cons. Experienced hires will be severely underchallenged and not considered for growth opportunities; Chevron HR doesn’t care about anything you learned from any other company, even though their own HR practices are weak. This is a relationship and politics based culture that views performance as secondary, which means you have no chance relative to someone who has already been there 20 years. They hold positions exclusively for people from their own development program, even though they too are often ill equipped. The Chevron Way behavioral expectations lead to a friendly but artificial and passive-avoidant culture. About 50 percent of time is spent on bureaucracy vs real HR work. If you want money with minimal effort, this is a good choice. If you want to learn, grow and become a great HR professional, avoid. }",0.82

Enjoyed my time with Chevron. Good company,"{ Pros. Very inclusive, embraces diversity and very safety orientated. } { Cons. Posting for jobs was difficult. Sometimes it felt easier posting and interviewing for other employers than it did posting internally within Chevron. Very process focused and sometimes to the detriment of the organization. To some extent I believe some of the decision making tools (i.e. CPDEP) when applied incorrectly stifled innovation within certain segments at Chevron. }",0.82

Good opportunities for project managers. } { Cons. LOCATION: you WILL end up working in Houston, Bakersfield, or Nigeria. San Ramon is no longer an option except a couple of corporate departments, which live in constant fear that they may be moved to Houston. LAYOFFS: 30% of my unit was laid off in 2015, more were affected in the subsequent year. If you are in a wrong place at a wrong time, you are out; there is no mechanism for keeping good people. MEDIOCRITY: there is little appreciation for technical skills and work. The attitude is that being an industry leader is too risky and being a follower is safer and cheaper; we do not have the resources to work on technically challenging problems and barely have enough time to evaluate solutions provided by vendors. }",0.8
